NOT GOOD FOR ME I THOUGHT IT WAS 100 PK One Star,1.0
"Lining in lighter pocket tore within a very short time, had to dab a little contact adhesive between lining and leather to hold it in place and stop it bunching and snagging lighter. Purchased one black one brown, black one used most and has no centre seam down front lighter or rear coin pockets. Brown one has (pointless) decorative centre seam (as usually illustrated) front and rear. Front seam stitching has no reinforcing at lighter pocket opening. Looks likely to give trouble sooner rather than later. Leather is good and solid. Size is spot on for regular (84mm) packs of 20 (after a little use). O.k., But not the ""premium product"" I used to associate with the Buxton name many years ago. Could be better.",3.0

Bought this for my mom as hers was really worn out. Like the added addition of the zipper pocket! tried and true!,4.0
"I had been looking for a replacement for a cigarette case I'd had for over 25 years and lost. After reviewing several I settled on this one. It was very well made, the leather was soft, not stiff or cheap looking. I loved the little front pocket that kept my lighter handy and easy to keep up with. There is even a small zippered pocket for change or whatever else. I was very pleased with it. Unfortunately, I had not read the description well enough and I discovered this case DOES NOT fit the 100's. It was such a nice case that I gave it to my daughter rather than return it. She has been more than pleased with it. I'm hoping the new one I have ordered is as nice. Better than I expected",5.0
It's just what I wanted. Five Stars,5.0
Pretty wallet but to small for the cigarettes Three Stars,3.0
"I was disappointed to find the my 100's won't fit in this case. Otherwise, it was exactly what I wanted. If there is a bigger one just like this, I wish someone would point it out to me. I'd buy it in a heartbeat! Too short, but lovely material",3.0
Is very small. Doesn't  fit my smokes... Way to small for purpose.,2.0

"I cannot believe this case cost as little as it did.  I was skeptical of what the quality was going to be like after I ordered it.  When I received it I was amazed because it is real leather and it looks fabulous.

would not tell anyone else to buy this product too small",1.0
Bought this for my wife and did not read the fine print. I thought it safe to assume a women's cigarette case would hold 100's. Not the case (pardon the punn). so I had to return this and buy the correct size which of course can be found on Amazon. Does Not Hold 100's,1.0

"We tried these shirts in the pinpoint fabric, but after washing they are the worst wrinkled shirt I have ever tried.  I have a steam dryer and it looks like it was rolled into a ball wet and then dried, awful!  The quality is fine, but if you iron your own shirts beware.  Probably okay if you use the cleaners. Paul Fredrick dress shirt VERY hard to iron",1.0
Hard to find shirts that are not non-iron (which don't hold up well to commercial laundering) anymore. These are good. Perfect. Hard to find shirts that are not non-iron,5.0
"Below average for the money.  The button holes are poorly finished and the fabric is thin enough that you'll want to wear an undershirt.  I have no doubt it'll shrink badly if washed.  There is NO wrinkle control so it arrived folded but looked like an old rag when unpackaged.  This just adds to the fact it's cheap material.  I see this as a dry clean only occasional use dress shirt.

The sad thing is their other shirts may use better material but if they don't and I paid $69 for a shirt of this quality I'd return it.  My search continues for a good quality dress shirt at a reasonable price! Below expectations",2.0

"Good quality shirt, fit as expected. Good quality shirt",5.0
"As other reviewers have said, this shirt fit fine out of the package, but with one washing (yes, I read the label directions), the shirt sleeve shrank significantly in length (more than 1"", leaving no cuff exposure possible on me with a jacket), and the collar shrunk enough to be uncomfortable to button. Still fine for a use as a casual shirt with some jeans, it seems well made and with a comfortable fabric, but the shrinkage makes this an unacceptable product for a dress wardrobe. That's really a shame, because the shirt feels great otherwise. Shrinks excessively when washed, unacceptable as a staple of your dress wardrobe.",2.0
"This shirt was the right size when it arrived.  After I washed it once in cold water, it shrank excessively.  The sleeves shorten by one and a half inches.  I would not recommend this shirt or anything else from this vendor. Shrinks too much",1.0
It's ok Three Stars,3.0
"This shirt came slightly soiled apparently from the automatic folding machines.  Paul Frederick customer service was easy to deal with.  However, the shirt ran a bit small.  The supposed 35"" sleeves were barely long enough, and my husband has consistently worn a 16-1/2 x 35 shirt size for years.  Be aware that there is no wrinkle-guard protection in this all-cotton shirt.  I didn't notice that when ordering, and it was a challenge to iron the ""rumpled look"" out. Paul Frederick customer service was easy to deal with",3.0

"Gorgeous shirt, fits as expected and looks just as sharp in person. My one complaint about the Paul Fredrick shirts is that the cuff only has one button. It fits loosely around my wrists so I had the tailor move the button for a better fit.

But for that I would have given five stars. If only it had two cuff buttons!",4.0

"I've worn this shirt about every other week for a little over a year now, and it's held up very well. No fraying around the cuffs, the buttons remain secure, and the feel of the cloth remains butter-smooth. It costs a wee bit more than other lesser-quality shirts, and I think the extra expense is worth it. A good blue shirt that should hold up well over time",4.0
"I was looking at the previous review and I think they missed the boat on this one. I don't think they understood what they purchased. This is a pinpoint 2 ply oxford. Naturally very wrinkle prone. This doesn't make the shirt a bad one. In fact in my mind it's on of the best quality shirts you can buy. You must either be very good with a iron and starch or have these pressed for $1.50. I recommend the latter but my wife does an ok job ironing these. I own about 20 Paul Frederick shirts and I like them all. You cant beat the quality especially if get them on sale like I do.

I also recommend Kirkland (Costco brand) which is the best shirt on the market other than brooks brothers,

These are much better than the other brands like, Van Hussein, Geoffrey Bean and Claiborne for sure... Quality shirts every time",5.0
"This is a great shirt, but with any quality shirt, it requires careful laundering. However, you will find it at a better price directly on the Paul Frederick website. Great Shirt requires care",3.0
"Don't buy this shirt unless you plan to spend lots of money on laundry.  For the price, I expected a shirt that would be basically wrinkle free.  I have many all cotton shirts that do not need to be ironed after every washing.  This is not one of them.  Not worth the cost. Looks like a crumpled up Newspaper",1.0

"Other reviewers said these shirts were hard to iron. I should have listened. Once you do get them ironed you can be guaranteed that any movement will bring those wrinkles back immediately. I wore the shirt for 2 hours and it looked like I'd slept in it for a week. Creases, wrinkles oh my!",2.0

"If you want a look that takes it back to the Old School, buy this shirt. It isn't as appreciated as it used to be, but it's just as relevant now as it was back then. Perfect with a classic black tie for job interviews. However, stay aware of the buttons leading up to the cufflinks. Sometimes they can snap off if not attended to. Other than that, a shirt of sophistication. Guaranteed. For the classic Gentleman",5.0

"While clearly an excellent mask for the novice and professional ninja, I purchased it primarily for winter sports.  It is extremely comfortable while skiing and snowboarding, and the touch of silk while sitting upon the lifts seems to provide a calm soothing feeling to offset the pain from my numerous falls on the moguls.  It keeps you cool from your own body heat but simultaneously keeps your face warm despite the freezing temperatures around you.  It is very breathable, but my only issue was that it did trap the moisture of my breath. Great for ninjas and winter sports",4.0

"The seller was courteous and prompt, and when I suggested that the shipping cost was too high, they graciously lowered it. However, the balaclavas I received were not silk. The tag on the inside clearly stated that they were 100% cotton. Perhaps I was shipped the wrong item, but sellers shouldn't misrepresent products like that. If I'd complained to the seller, I feel confident that they would have refunded my money, but these were for halloween costumes (which turned out just fine), so I didn't have time to deal with returns and such.

"This product was exactly as described. I've used it for running, both as a base layer and also the only layer.  It has helped keep my face warm from the biting MN wind.  With more severe windchills I've put a fleece  balaclava over it and it formed a great base layer. warm",4.0
"I am very disappointed with this item.  First, in moderately cold skiing weather 10-20 degrees fahrenheit, my face was a little cold through this mask.  While skiing downhill, the wind shred through this mask.  Second, after only 1 weekend of moderate use, the front of the mask was worn away.  I would not be surprised if it tore during the 2nd weekend of use.  Third, I have a medium sized head and this thing was wayyyy too big for me.  Finally, the mask traps the moisture of my breath and freezes it, making the mask uncomfortable around the mouth area.

The only pros are that it is lightweight and breathable. Not Durable or Made for Cold Weather",2.0
"This lightweight balaclava is perfect for winter, summer, spring or fall.  Helps keep you warm in the winter yet light enough to wear on a hot summer day.  It is easy to put on and take off and so cheap that you throw it away after each job.  Slip it on before you are in view of any CCTVs and simply dump it after you are far enough away it won't be connected to the scene.  It prevents sweat and hairs from being left at the scene so the police are unlikely to get a DNA print, and makes it impossible for anyone to ID you.

"When I first saw this offer last year, I couldn't believe it was genuine. I was used to paying $10 to $15 a pair for wool socks. When they arrived, I still found it hard to believe. But these are excellent quality socks that have held up well through heavy use and lots of washings. The three pair are serving well alongside their far more expensive drawer-mates. It's hard to imagine someone getting excited by a pair of socks, but these are worth getting excited about. I agree that a color other than gray would help to stretch these socks further in my wardrobe, but for the price... I ain't complainin'! WOOL SOCKS FOR $3 A PAIR!!!???",5.0
"Socks seem like a strange kind of thing on which to write a review, but these socks are special. I placed an order for a friend of mine who runs a soup kitchen in Poplar Bluff Missouri. It was an order of about 60 pairs of these socks which probably seemed pretty strange to the people at Sportsman's Guide, but they sent them anyway. I didn't think much about it until I got an e-mail from Joni, the lady in Poplar Bluff, that the socks had arrived.
She told me that you would think that the socks were made of gold the way the people at her free store responded to them. They had NEVER seen such socks!! They were soft and they were thick and warm. Most of them had never even heard of wool socks.
Now I don't think twice about wool socks because I love them but it gave me real pause to think that there were people who had never even heard of such a wonderful thing. These people couldn't believe that someone would just give them something this good. Yes, this good.
So if you're thinking of buying some of these why don't you get an extra pair or two and give them to someone who needs them. It will be an education, I promise, and your gift will reward you many times over when you experience the gratitude such a small thing can evoke. These socks are golden!!",5.0

"I like the thicknesss of the socks and because of this, I know they'll be warm enough for anything that the snow has to offer. I would really like these socks if they came in a variety of colors; grey is not a very exciting color, however; as long as you're warm, who cares about excitement. thick winter warmth",3.0
"My first review but I have to say......About 15 years ago I developed an allergy to nickle (earrings, necklaces, belt buckles, buttons, bracelets!) and stopped wearing most jewelry. I have to tape over my belt buckles or any metal that contacts my skin and was diagnosed as severely allergic by my doc after allergy skin test. About a year ago I got my ears repierced with my daughter so we could have fun wearing jewelry and have tried every kind of hypo allergenic earring I could find: Studex, Sterling Silver 925, Surgical Steel, 14k gold, and had allergic reactions to all of them if worn for even an hour. Studex that my ears were pierced with was the worst! Bleeding, red itchy swollen earlobes a few weeks to heal in between each time I wore earrings! Searched Amazon for an hour to find these and did some research. They work as promised! I had to force them through (holes had partially closed) and had some initial healing for about 2 weeks. Now I'm wearing them 24/7 no problems! It's a first and really wonderful. I will get more. This size is a bit small for a main earring so I will get the next size up. THANK YOU. No irritation for severe nickle allergy sufferer!",5.0
"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for ""sensitive"" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) . a relief to wear these",5.0
"I just had my ears pierced a little over two months ago and I thought the minor discomfort was part of the healing process.  I decided to try these but honestly didn't expect there to be a difference.  Within hours of wearing these my ears had no discomfort at all.  Again, my ears weren't red or swollen but just had a very minor ache.  I'd recommend these to people even if it's not the last resort to wearing earrings.

I also really like the small simple style so these were perfect for me anyway.  I've found it very difficult to find earrings I like in stores because they all seem so big and overbearing.  I'm sure that I will end up buying more pairs of these in a similar style and definitely give preference to titanium earrings. Pleasantly Surprised",5.0
"I just got these a few weeks ago (along with a pair of titanium hoops) and love them. I haven't been able to wear earrings for years because of nickel allergies, and these earrings haven't given me any trouble whatsoever! I can wear earrings again!",5.0
these are the only earrings that have not caused an allergic reaction and they are very pretty too. lovely,5.0
"I have only owned these earrings a few weeks, but I'm quite pleased with them.  Before buying these, I had been completely unable to wear earrings for many years.  My earlobes would swell, turn red, and bleed immediately after inserting even ""hypoallergenic"" earrings.  I've tried other brands, such as Simply Whispers, which I really wanted to love, but I simply couldn't wear them.  I'd given up and given away most of my earrings and hadn't bought or tried any earrings for a few years.

When these first arrived, I had trouble inserting them because my earlobes had almost grown closed, and I traumatized my ears a bit.  Over the next several days, I removed them at night, then irritated my ears again when I reinserted them in the morning.  Finally, I decided to just leave them in and allow my ears to heal, and that has worked just fine.  Now my ears have healed, and I haven't bothered to remove the earrings for a couple of weeks.

I noticed that in a review for one of the other styles, the reviewer had two complaints: that the ad appeared misleading in that it looked like you were purchasing three pairs of earrings, and that the 3mm size was tiny.  So take note:  you are ordering just one pair of earrings, and the 3mm (mini) size earrings are very small - take a look at a ruler to get an idea - but they provide an understated bit of sparkle.

I highly recommend these for people with metal allergies - I'm planning to get another pair. Earrings I can wear!",5.0
The Suspenders are fine except one of the tongues or the buckles was put it the wrong way and the fastening of this one is not as secure as the correct buckle and the tongue sticks awkwardly out.

Actually I didn't buy them as liner gloves. I was looking for a light weight glove with some flexibility and durability. These fit the bill. They are perfect for dog walking in moderate winter weather. Fingers are a little short but they still work. Liner gloves,4.0
"I think this is a case of getting what you pay for.  Although they look ok and are pretty warm, the pair I got for my husband has some definite problems.  The two gloves (sized L/XL) are two different sizes.  One glove fits fine, but the other is much smaller (the fingers don't fit all the way on one side).  Because of this bad fit, he wore them for the first time this morning and the smaller glove is already ripping.  No good. Cheap",2.0
"1.13.12 UPDATE: I've now been using these gloves through all of December and half of January and I continue to recommend them. Many of my runs have taken place in temperatures within the 20s, and while the gloves are not winter gloves, they are working out. My hands are cold as I start my run and the tips of my fingers do sting initially, but after about half a mile or a mile, I've warmed up enough that my hands become comfortable. In fact, I think if I were wearing anything heavier, the warmth of the gloves might become too much. These allow me to go for 8-mile runs without feeling like I have to take them off. As long as you're okay starting your run with slightly cold hands, these could be for you.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've been using these gloves on and off for about a month now, and so far I've found them to be a great purchase. I usually go for runs around 5 a.m., and this has allowed me to test them out in temps that have resided in the mid-30s. So far, so good. They do the job. If I remember, I'll post an update once the weather gets even colder.

My only concern is the fit. I'm an average size guy, and there's something a little uncomfortable about the way they fit, as if the fingers could've been cut lower, that makes me think I'd have an issue with them if I were a taller guy with bigger hands. That being said, I'd purchase these again if I had to do it all over again. At this price point, you can't beat them. A really good purchase",4.0

The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure. Durability issues",3.0

"Over quite a few years I've bought and worn Silver Forest jewelry, especially earrings, and used to get so many compliments on them.  Unfortunately, their aesthetic has changed over time, away from what made their pieces special and interesting.  Many of their designs used to be kind of contemporary and unusual, with the multiple, individually moving components, contrasting materials and textures, and subtle color palettes creating a unique feel.  They were sort of sophisticated but relatively affordable.  Some designs veered more towards conventionally pretty or delicate, while some were more like abstract modern art pieces, but all were pretty well made and special.  These days, it seems they go more towards an overly ""pretty"" aesthetic, too overwhelmingly using motifs such as lace, flowers, tear-drop shapes, and such, all made with less interesting materials.  Such things are not bad, necessarily, but the variety is gone, and their pieces are just not very special anymore.  I'm very disappointed and will probably not seek out their products as I have over the years.  Too bad. Sadly, Silver Forest has gone downhill",3.0

"Watch out with these.  I bought them for my wife and after less than three (3) weeks they started falling apart.  The center turquoise is glued on and it just fell off.  They are useless now.  Also, the picture is somewhat deceptive.  The back of the earring is a flat separate piece of plastic and is not connected to the metal part of the earring so it flaps around.

These are cheap and fall apart quickly. Cheap Earrings",2.0
"These are the most comfortable things I have ever worn on my feet; I bought them for gymnastics and I'm so happy that I did; They are so comfortable! But just in case you didn't know: the straps are only attached at the back of the slipper; So you have to sew them into the front- I'm assuming for proper fit; This is a bit annoying- coupled with the fact that there is no loop or area of fabric to sew them into without having to see your handy work through the front(no good if your terrible at sewing like me); And they soil easily;This should be expected of course(especially if they are white). Still, as my title suggests,they earn 5 stars and more because they truly are that comfortable; Especially when walking on carpet; I can't well explain why, because the shoes really have no padding; But they hug your feet and support your arch to an extent (I'm assuming these would not be as comfortable for flat footed people).The price is great and, if you are into ballet, what do you have to loose. if just because they are so comfortable..",5.0

There are lots of imitations out there, but only Birkenstock products hold up the way you need them to.

"Wearing the same style Betulas purchased years ago (and they're still going strong!), I was so sure of my size that I ordered 3 new pairs in assorted colors. Well, no such luck. The footbeds of the ""new"" size 38's are slightly smaller than on my old sandals. My toes were hitting the edge of the footbed. Not comfortable at all. (I'm a size 7 in regular shoes).

So, I had to return them at my expense, and then pay the shipping to get the larger sized relacements sent to me. Now the fronts fit fine, but on the whole, the new size is a bit too large for the rest of my feet!

"I am a size 12 mens... so according to all the reading I have done, I'm supposed to order women's boots 2 sizes larger.  When I ordered these, I got a 15... and I probably could wear a 16.  So...  these things run pretty small.  They will be used for a costume getup (no, it's not a drag outfit!).

Another thing I quickly discovered... maybe this is just because I have never worn knee high boots or heels of any kind before...  but when you stand flat and do not move, the ""plane"" of the bottom of the boot is wrong.  First, the toe plate... it's not so much curved as it is a slight ""V"" shape.  It is possible to stand on your toes, simply by leaning forward and shifting your weight a little.  When you lean back again, the heel comes back down to the ground and your toes roll up a little.  This may be difficult to imagine, and again, it may just be because I have not worn heels before.  But it seems like it should have a flatter sole.

The 'patent leather' is VERY thin.  Not that I expected much, it's a $50 boot, not a $500 one.  In a way this is good because it stretches to stay tight around my huge calves.

I can tell it's going to take a while to get used to walking in them, but I'll get comfortable with them in time.

"I bought the 3-pack of black v-neck CK's via Amazon in May'09.  I purchased men's size ""Medium"" based on the fact that I bought the same 3-pack last year in size ""Large"" and the fit was bigger than I wanted.  I am 5'10"", 195lbs and usually wear a size ""Large"" in most men's tops.

In terms of sizing I was looking for a fit that is slightly snug versus too baggy (as the Larges were for me) so now that I have the size Mediums they are working out much better for my preference (especially since I've noticed they also tend to stretch out a bit over time).  Bad news is I have 6 of these tshirts clogging up my dresser drawers now, good news is since I have the Medium and Large sizes I can gain a few pounds and I'm still good to go (beer me).

I do agree with some other reviewers that CK tshirts do tend to be thin material and they aren't your typical stand alone t-shirt you can show off about town.  They are good tshirts under another piece of clothing, as pajama top, or working around the yard.  I actually like the fact that CK v-necks are thin because they are very comfortable to wear for incognito usage.

Style-wise a good looking t-shirt with nice looking v-neck shape.

Overall: 4 out of 5 stars. High marks for looks and comfort for my intended usage, minus 1 star for the slightly strange sizing causing inventory buildup in my dresser drawers.

"I bought this for my brother to wear as an undershirt for when he has to wear dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and he loves them.  His favorite part about these shirts is that you can barely feel the material in comparison to all of his cotton shirts.  So, they're definitely light/thin material.  He would never wear them as a regular shirt unless it's in a casual setting (e.g. to bed).

Regardless, they work GREAT for wearing under buttoned dress shirts or dressy sweaters, and I'll definitely be buying the white ones for him soon enough.

Oh, as for the fit, I obviously can't personally comment on it, but for him the XL worked great.  He's all around a huge guy (height, weight, and his shoulders) and while he normally wears XLs, sometimes they fit too tight on him due to his shoulders and neck.  This XL fit perfectly with a little room to spare, so if you're a bigger person with regards to your height and shoulders, get your normal size, otherwise definitely size down. Great for undershirt use",5.0

He used them anyway and I continued to wash them. Eventually that tint went away. I ordered 3 packs this time. 2 were made in Bangladesh and one in Haiti. Sure enough, after I threw them in the dryer to fluff up, all 3 of the Haiti-made shirts had the pink tint, while the Bangladesh ones were still white. Who knows.... This is strange...",4.0

"These shirts are great V-Neck's that fit perfectly, are comfortable, and look great!

They can be used as a black under-shirt, if ever needed, but I love to wear these as every day shirts.  The nice cotton design is comfortable and washes great. After many washes I still find the shirt to be comfortable and fit the same way as always (the first wash/dry might make it - like all shirts - shrink a little).

These are some of my favorite shirts to wear, and I wear them all the time.

They fit as you would expect, I purchased medium (as I purchase medium shirts always) and it fit as it should.  At first it was a little too big, but after the first wash/dry it shaped properly and fits perfectly now.

The material is thick, and it doesn't' feel cheap at all, while it is nice and soft and great for sleeping in too (your significant other will love the softness of the material!).

When I purchased them, they were on sale and a great value - but even at regular price these shirts are definitely a great buy and can be worn as an every day shirt, as a black under shirt, or as a nice comfortable at home/night shirt.  I have recommend these (and the white versions, as undershirts) to my friends and purchase new ones every so often when I lose them, or people take them!

Lastly, they are made to last! I have had some of these for more than a year (coming up on almost two years, actually) and they still look great and fit perfectly -- after about a year I usually retire them to night shirts and get new fresh ones (as I tend to stain them here and there and wear them so much that I like to purchase fresh ones to wear out -- don't don't let that make you think they don't last, I could absolutely still wear them out if I wanted to!).

Calvin Klein is a great brand, and makes great V-Necks (in all colors!). Great V-Necks! Wear them every day.",5.0

"I love CK t-shirts. They are very soft and comfortable. It is hard to determine if the size is ""true."" With vanity sizing these days, every brand seems to be different. I typically wear an XL in most brands (6'0"" tall and 215 lbs - 44R suit size). I usually get XL to compensate for my beer belly, but these were quit large and baggy for me personally with my dimensions. I then ordered size Large because they were such a great price and find that they fit much better. Still roomy enough not to grip my belly too much and fit my frame much better. The V-Neck helps draw attention away from that awful looking beer gut. Further, the length is great as I am fairly tall in the torso and have a problem with most brands because they are not long enough. They did not shrink on the initial two washes/dries, but in my past experience with CK t-shirts, after repeated washing/drying they do tend to shrink a bit and lose their softness (around 1 year of use) - which is probably typical of most all brands and the repeated abuse of machine washing and high heat drying.

"Update:

I'm about to place my 3rd order of these shirts. I ordered 9 over one year ago, and 9 one year prior to that. I am one of those guys who just sweats a lot. To ensure the shirts the world sees stay alive for longer, i wear these guys underneath. If I were to rate these shirts lower for any reason, it would be that the collars at the side of my neck wrinkles, But that's specific to me and my body, because my neck is larger than the body size the shirt is built for. At the V of the neck, the shirt maintains it's structure, rests comfortably and it's so thick that I notice it, even when it's under a shirt, a tie and a v-neck sweater. I had a thought of buying another shirt to see if these could be beat, but I can't see the reason to risk it. I realized today that I may be over the clock on buying these and I was. I told myself to replace them every 6 months and it's been a year. Did these shirts lose their color? After a year of my use, and zero bleach, yes. But I don't think there is a single white shirt on the planet that can endure a year with me, my sweat, my abuse and my cleaning techniques. The color fading is the only reason I remembered I needed to replace them.

OLDER Revew:
I wear white undershirts every day to extend the life of my expensive collard shirts. These guys soak up my sweat, and wash very easy. They also have delivered on being white for longer than quite a few other shirts I have owned before them. I'll be reordering more of these when they wear out, but for now, they're holding up quite well. Only flaw after 1 year of massive abuse is a little color fading.",5.0

Calvin Klein infrequently makes their t-shirts available in different colors. I bought these because they are just that.

"These are the best under shirts I've ever owned.  I picked up a pack at Costco a year and half ago and now wished I would have bought a few more packs as they never have them in black.  The medium is a great fit for me as a tall and lean man (6'1"" 155lbs) and, unlike most t-shirts or under shirts, they haven't ""shortened"" on me after constant washing / drying.

Obviously I paid a lot less for these at Costco; about half what amzn is asking for them, but I'm willing to pay the higher price as these are well worth it from a quality stand point.  I wear them as under shirts for dark dress shirts but also wear them as a casual t-shirt as well. Willing to pay",5.0
"The ideal v-neck undershirt for me.  Feels quality, just the right thickness, and my favorite aspect of the shirt is the cut of the v-neck.

"I have been wearing these CK v-necks as my primary white undershirt on weekdays or around-the-house weekend shirt for about 3 years now. Over that time I have probably purchased 6 or 7 packages, some through Amazon and some through other retailers. The first few I had no problem with, but after that, the length varied drastically with each new package I got. The variance between shortest and longest runs about 4 inches. Within a package, they are consistent, but not when comparing those from different packages. This is a problem when using under dress shirts, as the short ones can come untucked very easily and bunch above your pant waistband, or if wearing solo, you get to show off your stomach whenever you raise your hands above eye level. If you get a package and after a wash they seem shorter than they should be, exchange for a different package to try again.

Aside from length, the quality seems pretty consistent, though I've had a few sloppy ""lumpy"" shoulder seams now and again. For the price, you cannot complain too much for this. Inconsistent length is an issue",3.0

"These shirts are definitely good quality, but the sizing is at least one full step (if not maybe a step and a half) larger than normal. I usually wear either a large or extra-large shirt (for comparison, an American Apparel crew t-shirt in a large fits me well but maybe a tad towards the small end of the range.) I bought these in a medium and not only do they fit, they're significantly looser than an American Apparel shirt in large. It seems like CK is doing some vanity sizing in their t-shirt line. Good quality, sizing runs at least a size (or more) large",4.0
"I know the description says that these are t-shirts, but really they are undershirts... as in not the t-shirts you just wear on their own.

So to that end, they work well. They are thin, so that you are not wearing bulky layers of clothing. They are extra long, so that they stay tucked in. They are soft and comfy as well.

I'm surprised that others say the shirts run big since I'm 5'5"" and 160 lbs, and I wear a medium... just like my regular shirts.

The only real gripe I have (besides the high price) is that there is a tag on the shoulder that itches me. There's no tag on the neck, presumably to prevent an itchy neck, but then they put the tag on the shoulder. Kinda lame, but no biggie. great as an undershirt",4.0
"These seem to be good quality shirts.  The V is just the right depth, and the shirts are well-made with good material.  However, I ordered a Medium, and the size appears to be quite large.

"I don't get the negative reviews here ... I wear undershirts every day under a dress shirt and this is the best v-neck I have found in awhile.  I find with most v-necks the collars suck - either way too deep and you see an imprint of a deep V under your dress shirt, or they have a thick collar that's too tight.  This is pretty close to just right - just low enough that you can't see it, but not so low that it's WAY under the neck line of your dress shirt (brooks bros iron free, top button left unbuttoned).

Yes the material is thin - I like that, it's an undershirt.  Material is soft and seems to be high quality. No, these are good",4.0

"The shipping was very fast and on time. The price was also very reasonable.. but the quality of the t-shirts was not what I expected. I had to spend at least few minutes cutting the seams of the shirts. Also when I handwashed them for the first time, the black color bleeded alot. It doesn't bleed the second time but it does bleed alot on the first time. Only the quality of cotton is good. It seems very durable and it is actually pretty thick. Just OK.",3.0
"The quality of these shirts are pretty good. They are soft and seem durable. The only problem I had was that they were way too long. I'm fairly short (5'7""), and the mediums were about 6 inches below my beltline. Too long",2.0
"At ~10 each these are not well made.  The material is thin with long loose strings on most seams and size is too big.  Dockers T-Shirts are a great deal at ~4 each--I only wish they came in black!

"I switch out the band on my Panama Hat depending on what I'm wearing, and how dressy I want to be...black for dressy, colors for more casual.. These are very high quality, and easy to change.

It is adjustable to any hat size. The hook pin needs some consideration.

I make sure it is tight enough it doesn't fall off when flip it onto my head or I set my hat down upside down on the table. The pin is shaped into a hook and I had no trouble with the point as long as it is not strapped too tight around the hat. nice pleated hat band",4.0

But for 5 dollars... they are a good deal. Especially if it is for a costume, or you just wanna add another pair to your collection. I would recommend these, just because of the low price. It can't hurt to buy them. They may not be my favorite pair but I will surely still use them occasionally. However they did fit me nicely and I wear a size 8 1/2.

"I bought these for a Halloween costume and for that purpose, they worked just fine. The foot is made out tights-like material and slips on easily. The ruffle is pretty, but oddly doesn't actually make a full circle- it just kind of overlaps at a random point and the ends aren't even finished, so it's a little bit scraggly. I guess that the nylon-style foot led to some sweating, because the bottoms made the dye from the inside of my shoes absorb into the sock- I washed them, but now the bottoms are blue. The shoes were cheap costume shoes, so I can't really blame that on the sock, but if you want the bottoms to stay white, beware colorful shoes. I thought I might wear them with ankle boots in a non-costume outfit, but they kept sort of slinking into my boot and with the scraggly edges, I wasn't crazy about looking like my feet were unraveling all day. I give them three stars, but I would just buy them if you have a one-night costume need and then toss them. Good For Costumes, Not So Much For Everyday Wear",3.0

Exceptionally modern design just ""screams"" quality in design.  Love this ring and would HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.  Have purchased other jewelry from seller based on this ring, my first purchase.  ALL HAVE BEEN WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD (OR SILVER)!!  Don't even hesitate...buy this ring and start enjoying it today!  LOVE IT! EXCEPTIONAL BEAUTY",5.0
"This is a beautiful ring, probably even more beautiful than the picture shows, because it glows in the light, and the colors are complementary.  I should comment that it is a heavy ring and that it is rather thick, so it is felt between the fingers.  If you are not used bigger rings, it may take time to adjust to it. As Beautiful as the Picture",5.0
"If you love amber and unique design, then this is the ring for you.  As some reviewers have said, the band is not tapered and it's big - but the ring is substantial and you really do get used to the round band.  There are 3 different colors of amber - honey, butterscotch and green.  This is a very nice piece of jewelry without the high dollar price tag.  It took 2 days to arrive at my home, so they don't fool around when it comes to delivery of their product. Definitely lives up to 5 stars!! If you love amber....",5.0
"I've had my eye on this ring for a while.  Finally, last weekend I decided to buy it.  It arrived yesterday, and all I can say is WOW.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  The colors are beautiful and play the light very well (just wait 'til you see it in natural sunlight).  I wear it on my middle finger and it's comfortable.  What a unique piece of jewelry.  Don't hesitate to buy this ring--it's gorgeous and the price is right. Buy it!",5.0
"As other reviewers have noted, the ring has a rather wide band. Almost like wearing a key ring. Knowing in advance that it was on the wide width side before I bought it, I wasn't suprised and didn't mind the width when it showed up. Arrived in a plain red jewlry box with black foam interior. Nice enough for giving as a gift. The ring itself is very pretty. I think the amber nuggets look a bit plastic but that is the nature of amber especially in small nuggets. Overall I am very satisfied with the ring and will be buying some of the additional pieces the seller who provides this ring also offers on Amazon. Overall very pleased with ring",4.0
"I got this ring for Christmas and I love it--and it seems to match almost everything!  It's even lovelier in person and I've gotten tons of complements on it.  The only issue with the ring is that the band is very thick and makes it slightly uncomfortable on my hand.  However, I'm hoping to adjust to the ring soon because it is so pretty. Beautiful ring...",5.0
"I've been watching this ring for a long time.  When the price dropped I jumped on it.  I'm  happy I did. I specifically bought it to wear on my index or middle finger, I'm glad I did because its a little bulky for me to be wear on the ring finger.  I haven't tried it as a thumb ring, yet.  The day I ordered the ring I got an email saying it had been shipped.  I received the ring the next day!  Bonus!  Great ring and fast delivery. Great ring, great bargain buy",5.0
"This was my favorite ring. I lost it. I hope some day I will find it but it has been missing for quite a while.
The ring itself is a bit thick, but that's the only negative thing I can think of. The stones are bigger than the rings I normally wear, but not too big. It's not easily adjustable, but I consider that to be a good thing. Rings that adjust easily also wear easily.
It reminded me of planets. It was like wearing planets on my finger.

EDIT 10/27/2012:

I FOUND IT! I FOUND IT! I JUST FOUND IT A FEW MINUTES AGO! I thought I had lost it in a hotel room four years ago but it must have actually fallen off when I was packing away some old baby clothes! It's a little tarnished after being in a box of stuff but it still looks great! :D Loved this ring",5.0
I bought this ring a year ago. The design is pretty unique and attractive. You won't be wrong with size because the band adjusts easily. I'd love it if the band would be thinner. The thick round band ruins the impression from this ring and makes wearing it uncomfortable. I still wear it occasionally because the ring matches almost any clothes. The thick band ruins the look,3.0
"I read all these great reviews about this ring and it looks good in the photo.  When I received it, well, it looks kind of cheap -- like a toy almost.  I was not really happy with it at all.  It's ok but not like the photo not like photo",2.0
"There's not too much I can add that hasn't been said.  It's a very nice ring.  The band is a bit thicker than ideal, but it's not so thick that you won't want to wear it.  I do find that the smaller stones don't look as prominent in real life as in the pictures online for some reason.  Because of these small issues, it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, although a significant price drop could gain that 5th star back.  I'm glad that I have this ring as part of my jewelry collection.  It's pretty and elegant and unique.  It goes with all different outfits, and people notice it. Happy with Ring",4.0
"This is a very unique ring. The colors are beautiful. I would have given it 5 star if it was not too bulky. My fingers are short so it kinda makes it chubbier. I bought this knowing it was bulky or big, but now that I am wearing it, it does look big. Will post a pix so you can judge for yourself before buying it. Very unique ring",4.0

This ring is supposed to be adjustable but I needed pliers to make it a little smaller- but that is my only complaint. I've gotten many compliments on it. The stones are beautiful and the same colors as shown in the photo. It also goes with everything. Unique and fun!,4.0
"I am so picky about my jewelry, but I can't really afford much. However, when I saw this ring my heart skipped a beat - these are *my colors*!! and what a gorgeous ring for such a reasonable price!
I just got the ring today and I am so pleased with it. I think perhaps the style isn't for everyone but that's a very good thing! I don't want the same jewelry as everyone else ;) Absolutely perfect!",5.0
"I received this item for Christmas and was very pleased. It is very bold and moderately large, but I do like things like this sometimes. I love having the different types of amber (very pretty). Since it is a bigger ring, I would suggest you get this for an index or middle finger (unless you won't be wearing another ring on the same hand). I'd also not wear it right next to another ring as the silver band could get scratched. Size is pretty true, but the band is mildly adjustable - I was able to open the band a bit with some well-applied pressure (not easy, but possible). If you need to adjust this and are afraid of damage, take yours to a jeweler.

I also have the earrings that match. Unique and bold!",5.0
"The ring is pretty much as pictured (I assume amber stones will always vary slightly in color, inclusions, and clarity). As others have remarked, it is substantial (perhaps 8-10 gage), so if your fingers do not taper slightly toward the base, you might be uncomfortable.  The quality and level of finish look excellent to me. I think the price is great for what you're getting--you're probably not going to find something like this at the mall, and certainly not at this price. I love the design because it doesn't look like most other silver pieces you see--a rep from the company told me their pieces are designed and produced in Europe.

But I really want to comment on the customer service--it is exceptional!  I got my ring as a gift and it arrived Christmas Eve. Day. I don't know if it was the ""open"" nature of the ring or just a goof but it was too big for my finger, and the stones were already angled such that their mounts were touching, so I was nervous about adjusting it myself. I called up expecting to leave a message (because you don't exchange through Amazon, and they don't have a formal RMA/tracking process, which made me nervous--basically you return it with a letter explaining why) but not only did someone answer the phone, they also answered some questions and set up the exchange without having received the too-large one back first. I got my replacement ring on the 30th and I am very happy! Great ring, excellent service",5.0

"I have been wearing berets for 40 years and have owned many, many berets and this is the best of the lot. Love this beret...",5.0
"This beret is very well made with a sturdy flexible cloth band instead of the stiff leather one found in the Basque berets, and it is not as full cut or floppy, which is what I was looking for because I have a thin head that gets lost under a large hat. It is still not as small as I would like, but it is comfortable and stylish. Not So Floppy as the Basque Type",4.0
"I have this same hat in camel & like it so much I decided to find it it in black. I was delighted to find one on line. It was shipped quickly and packaged carefully, but the hat was a disappointment. I ordered a size M and this clearly was not the same M as the camel hat. Also the inner band (grosgrain ribbon) was so stiff, it was uncomfortable. It didn't seem to be of the same high quality of the other hat I have. I returned the hat. I do want to acknowledge that I was quickly refunded for my return. sizing off",2.0
"I had two of these berets and they were my favorite hats. I lost one when the airlines lost my luggage. I ordered a replacement in the same size, but it was too small. For some reason, the sizing is now smaller than a couple of years ago. This was confirmed by both the retailer and the manufacturer. (As I need an extra large and that is the largest size, I'm down to one beret.) Sizes are smaller",3.0

it was very nice but just sits on my head with no cling. Plus it's very shallow. Not something you can pull down to secure on your head. I measured and ordered the one that was my size but just too big. Great quality but not the one for me,4.0

I wanted cotton handkerchiefs. These are a polyester blend and have more of a polyester than a cotton feel. signature collection handkerchiefs are polyester,1.0
"Softer than Russian toilet paper but not as soft as cotton. They get the job done and if one gets stained beyond use I am not going to lose sleep about throwing one away.

After washing, they are much softer than straight out of the box.

Excellent for nose-blows. Poor for cleaning glasses.

Not the best I have used, but they are, after all, just cheap hankies. Softer than Russian toilet paper",3.0
"I have never had handkerchiefs before so I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into.  But I wanted to stop wasting so much paper with facial tissues; so I figured I would give it a shot.
When I received these, the seller got them to me faster than expected and I appreciate that, I was a little disappointed.  The seemed so thin.  I could see right through them, even when folded in half.  But they do the job great.  And being thin they easily go into a pocket without being bulky.

"I bought these to put pendents on for my children as part of our wedding ceremony. They are perfect weight and complimented the pendent perfectly. I bought 3 of these and they arrived quickly.

"First, I want to say I was shocked when this chain arrived so quickly. I even rechecked my orders on Amazon. This is a gorgeous chain. It is femine but very strong. The shine is great but not cheap looking. It is a very good looking and sturdy chain. I was going to make a necklace to sell out of it but have it on right now without any kind of pendant on it.

It arrived early (the vendor graciously took it upon themselves to ship it priority mail at no extra charge) and it was perfect.

"Every once in a while, you find finely crafted silver-work at a ridiculously low price and Gem Avenue is one of those rare finds.  I've bought several of their sterling silver chains, including 2 box links, and the quality exceeded all my expectations in each case.  The chains are sturdy, yet maintain their smooth flexibility over time. There is no ""play"" between the links and, though all are fine guage, even the thinnest has a heft that just feels ""expensive"" (kind of like the sound and solid feel of the closing of an expensive car door).  The clasps easily slide into their housing and the spring is taut yet easy to manage with no ""hanging"".

  I personally own only 1 box link chain, one my kids bought me about 10 years ago in a little specialty shop. It was just the right size for me (about 1/16th"" thick link), heavy, and cost $150.00 at the time.  I know, I swallowed my tongue, too.  But it was a very special celebration and came from their hearts with a little help from Mom.  Definitely a stretch on our budget but they felt the chain was important (and I bring it up as a comparative price for fine Sterling 10 years ago). But afterward I learned that there were roving silver artists who sold their work for whatever was necessary to build their business.  We just had to trip over them if we found them at all in this city or that.  Certainly, today you can find cheaply priced silver chains any number of places but, likely as not, you end up with a cheaply constructed chain, possibly even an overlay or plating, links that kink or break, clasps that don't quite ""seat"" properly or fail altogether.  Gem Avenue is the smooth ride on tarmac after a juddering of a day driving over rock-strewn.  These craftsmen take obvious pleasure and pride in their silver-work and it does show.  And to beat it all, they're pricing this fine sterling as if it was costume jewelry.  Oh, and they thoughtfully toss in a nice little jewelry box for each chain purchased.  Why spend so much time reviewing a few silver chains?  Heaven knows if there were problems with the products we'd see postings in those CAPITAL LETTERS with which some express their fury that something was not to their liking.  When a company obviously cares about their products and seems to see each silver chain as a representative of their company, as this company appears to, the suits need to know that the people doing the actual creative work are doing a cut above and that brings back repeat and new customers via referral and ""through the grapevine.

You will be quite happily surprised with what you buy here. Always a fine experience.

Very Best Regards,
Cycat Fine jewelry at a fine price",5.0

"I ordered two of the 18"" silver box chains.  First, they arrived in record time (I ordered from Gem Avenue) and each were packaged securely and boxed separately. The chains are exactly what I was hoping to receive.  They are sturdy without looking cheap (and actuallly look very expensive).  They hang nicely and the clasp looks well made.  I have two silver pendants that I like to wear often so it was important to get a chain for each that would withstand daily wear.  Additionally, I have long hair which can sometimes be problematic when wearing chains.  My hair can get caught in a clump near the clasp or I can inadvertantly break the chain when brushing my hair.  I chose the ""box"" type chain and this type of clasp for these reasons as it's the strongest chain available while still looking dainty.  I'm very pleased with both the quality and the price.  I tried to get the same kind of chain at our local department store and it was twice as much.  You won't be disappointed! Very Pleased!!!",5.0

"This chain is great for pendants, but as someone who rarely takes of the chair, I would say: Be wary of durability, My chain gets caught on things, and the first one snapped, just be warned, the clasp can break, but at the price, its cheaper to buy a replacement every once and a while than find something more durable (and a lot more expensive).

"It was about six days before Christmas and I was searching all the local malls trying to find a chain to go with the ""O"" pendant that my dad had gotten to give my mom for a Christmas gift.  I could not find the chain I was looking for.  Finally, I decided to look on Amazon and at first didn't see anything I was interested in.  I went back and looked on Amazon again the next day and saw a thin box chain, but I didn't know what a box chain looked like and the pictures only showed but so much.  So, I decided to wait.  The next day, I went to work and one of my co-workers was wearing an ""O"" pendant on a thin box chain like the one I saw online.  So, I ran home during lunch that day and went on Amazon to buy the chain.  I was so worried I wasn't going to find a chain that could be delivered to my house by Christmas.  Finally, when I almost gave up, out of all the box chains and sellers on Amazon, there was only one seller, Gemavenue, who's last acceptable order date for the holidays was still within the time limits.  So, I bought their box chain and it was perfect because I was able to choose the length I needed and it was thin but sturdy, like I had been looking for.  I asked for express shipping and ordered it on a Thursday and Christmas was on Tuesday.  The chain arrived that Saturday.  I was so thrilled when it arrived.  It was the right length and had a pretty shine to it.  My mom opened it on Christmas morning along with the pendant and was so surprised.  She loved it.  It was perfect! Perfect!",5.0

"This is a fantastic watch display/storage case.  It is of quality construction and looks very elegant.  Each watch compartment has a nice leather type crafted pillow for your watch to wrap around.  These are nice pillows and of good construction.

The display case has plenty of room between the watches and the glass.  There is even enough room, both on the pillow and between the pillow and glass, to show off pocket watches.  This case shows off your watches very nicely.  Even my el-cheapo timex watch looks good in this case.

If I had to find something lacking, I would have but one VERY MINOR suggestion.  I think each watch compartment should be just a tad bit deeper or longer so that I could store any watch band links right with the appropriate watch.  I'm able to do that now, but not in a way the hides the extra links very well.  Like I said, a very minor complaint, not even big enough to lose a star to.

"I LOVE THESE BOOTS!!!  I have been riding for almost 15 years, and I can honestly say, that entire time I would long for good warm boots in the winter!!  I would dread getting off at some points because I knew my toes were going to throb the minute they touched the ground!  I do alot of outdoor riding, even in the winter months, and living in Northeast Pennsylvania you NEED a great pair of winter boots.  The older I got, the more I wanted durable, warm boots that were also comfortable enough to wear around the barn.  These are those boots!!  My toes stay warm even during the coldest months of winter and even during a trail ride!  They do feel a tad snug the first few times until they break in, but after that, they are wonderful.  I would recommend these boots for anyone who is looking for a durable, stylish WARM pair of winter boots!!

UPDATE APRIL 2014:

I JUST had to order another pair!  They lasted me the past 3.5 years and up until about Mid-January/Early February they were still keeping my feet considerably warmer than my warm season paddock boots.  They did start to crack and the soles were coming completely away from the rest of the boot, but I am at the barn 4-5 times a week, sometimes riding 2 or more horses a day.  They DO take a few rides to break in and they are a bit bulkier than your average paddock boot b/c of the insulation but I personally am not a fan of too small of an iron so I have had no issue with them becoming stuck in my irons.  And believe me, my trainer is big on ""drop your irons!"" and I have no problem getting my feet out or back in them.  I also don't lace them all the way up, I leave one out until they get really nice and broken in until I can do that, or my heel doesn't get as far down.  I had actually ordered a pair of Ariat Bossard Insulated Paddock Zips and sent them back b/c they were ridiculously stiff and tight.  Promptly ordered my old go too's and am happy I did because I got them in time to break them in before this winter season was over so no need to worry about that next year!  Happy riding :) Excellent Tough Boots!",5.0

I must say that without a doubt this is the most comfortable, and definitely the coolest hat I've ever worn. Love the CoolMax headband.  Plus if you get dirt on it as I did, picking it up with dirty gloves on, It's easy to clean.  I used a wet soft bristle tooth brush with a little mild detergent, brushed the dirt away and let it air dry.

"The material quality was good and the style was nice. However the hat was out of shape when I opened the box. It was also a little tight. Checking their return policy I found that I would have to pay for the return shipping fee which was almost half the price of the hat itself. I decided to keep it as a working hat when I do my yard work. Few days later I received an email from their customer service asking me about how pleased I was with their product. I told them I wasn't pleased with the condition of the hat, but decided not to return due to high return shipping fee. To my surprise they sent me next day a prepaid UPS label with which I returned the hat requesting for an exchange. Yesterday I received the exchange. This time they packed the hat snuggly inside a box, which was packed inside another larger box with packing paper. Although it took long time to receive the exchange their customer service is superb. I will buy product(s) from them again in the future. Nice Henschel Breezer hat",5.0
"I ordered this item for a trip I was going on where I needed a hat that not only blocked the sun but was cool as well.  The item showed in stock,  several days later I was notified the item was on back log until the 17th.  I contacted the vendor and asked them if they could expedite the shipment with the vendor, something I do routinely with my customers.  I was told they'd try.  I contacted their vendor who told me they would be shipping the items to Sportsman on the 13th.  I contact Sportsman indicating I would be leaving on the 21st and needed the item delivered the 20th and if they couldn't promise that delivery to cancel the order if it hadn't shipped by the 17th.

On the evening of the 17th they called and asked if I still wanted the item,  yes but i need it the 20th.  No problem  -- today i get a shipment notice indicating the item will be delivered the 23rd 2 days after i leave.  I don't know if i'll get the item before I leave but to pay 30% of the items cost and be told they cannot expedite the freight after they advertised it as a stock item is poor service, based upon the support i've received i'm not sure i'll be a return customer.

disappointed with amazon and sportsman for not factually indicating the stock status of item,  I understand that their computer systems may not be up to date but you don't find that out until after you place your order, and honestly I have had good experiences with Amazon until now.

XL in this hat much too large, even though  a Breezer Crushable with 4"" brim was an XL, it was only slightly large and used band liner to make hat fit slightly smaller and it works great.  Order best size for yourself per sizing chart, but hats may vary enough to require a different size. But don't let that frustrate you worth the patient when you get right fit.  I happen to measure right at break point between L and XL, so it sometimes takes trial and error.  Great hats and extremely satisfied. Henschel Hats worth the wait and getti g correct size.",4.0

Keep cool this summer with Henschel Breezer Hat.  It cools the heat of the sun and allows your head heat to escape in the breeze.  The chin strap keeps your hat on even in high winds.  Protecting your head from the sun's energy during solar max just makes sense. Breezer Hat is perfect for the summer sun,5.0
"Keeping sun off my face in tropical locations has become a priority.  The wide brim does just that, while the mesh sides keep your head well ventilated, which reduces sweating considerably.  The chin-string is a necessity for river travel by speedboat.  For the price, this is a real nice hat.  One thing though, it looks much better after some wear when a little dirty and slightly shabby, a condition which also eliminates the ""new hat, eh"" comments when relaxing at the end of a 40 degree Celsius day with fellow ex-pats.

"Face it: every wide brim hat is not exactly a style statement. But many are flat out dorky and ugly.  This one, however, I love.  It looks like a fedora, not a sun hat.  And as to doing its job of sun protection, it is very good.  The brim keeps sun off of my face and neck, areas where I have had to have squamous cells removed. My body temperature is cooler with the hat on than off. The open mesh allows heat to escape and for any breeze to cool my head.
My only possible caveat: the mesh is a fairly open weave. If one is bald and must keep sun from the crown of the head, then it could be a problem.  The top of the hat is solid and will protect from the noonday sun. The mesh would only be an issue for early/late sun coming in at an angle. Sun protection without looking stupid",5.0

"I have been looking for a hat to wear while working in the yard during the heinously humid Summer months here in the commonwealth.

I started looking around for a hat that would address all those shortcomings and everywhere I looked, I kept seeing ""Henschel Breezer"".  So, more digging led me to Amazon and all the reviews of said hat.  The reviews were good, the price was right and the best part is, made in America.

Ordered it and as with all things Amazon, it arrived on time and packaged perfectly to protect it.  I've used it every weekend and numerous other times in the aforementioned heinous heat and humidity and it has performed flawlessly.

"I bought this hat for a recent vacation to San Francisco area. It packed well and held up the whole trip.

We spent a lot of time in San Jose and Santa Cruz where the temps were in the 80s and a lot of sun. The hat kept my head cool, wicked the sweat, and I didn't get burned. I did use sun block, but worried less about re-application every 80 minutes on my face, ears and neck than I did for my arms and legs.

"After searching for a hat with a broad brim that would satisfy both me and my dermatologist, I took a chance and ordered the Breezer, sight unseen.  It lives up to the claims made in the description, including the ability to collapse for packing in a suitcase and still look good when unpacked. It's well constructed and sturdy without being heavy.  The fact that it's made in the US and still comes at a good price makes it all the more appealing. It's comfortable and sharp - not at all 'geeky'! Henschel Breezer Hat",5.0
"I purchased this hat for my teenage son who was traveling to the Dominican Republic on a mission trip.  We chose this hat for the wide, sturdy brim and the mesh which rings the entire hat.

"I was very pleased with this item. The quality of this product overall is excellant. Most hankerchiefs are of whats called a standard size (12 X 12), but this product was much larger (16 X 16). The hankerchiefs hold up well when washed however they do come out wrinkled so I would suggest ironing them. Using bleach also keeps the product looking pure white & brand new. The bleach isn't harsh on the product at all. I was surprised that this item shipped fast. I ordered on one day & about four days later I received it. This item fits in all sorts of mail boxes both large & small. So don't worry if your not home when it arrives because it should fit in your mailbox. My transaction was pleasant & sweet. I had no problems with the seller at all. I received nothing, but courtesy & respect. I would most defintly buy from this seller again. I do believe that the item was some what on the pricey end however I don't buy hankerchiefs on a daily and/or regular basis to know enough about that. Excellance",5.0

"We use 100% cotton handkerchiefs instead of Kleenex in our house, so I keep several dozen on hand.  I wash them in hot water and bleach them frequently, especially during cold and/or allergy season.  I bought two dozen of these.  After I washed these handkerchiefs for the first time, hems on about 1/3 of the handkerchiefs showed signs of fraying. I think that the quality of the cotton cloth is fine, but the tiny hems don't have enough seam allowance to prevent the fraying. I intend to pull out my sewing machine and repair the frayed hems right away, and I feel sure that the handkerchiefs will serve us well after that.  I didn't want to pay top dollar for handkerchiefs when we use so many. Not top quality, but I would purchase again",3.0

"This product is outstanding and the price on Amazon can not be beat. Buxton owns the rights to the Dopp name and produces these ""official Dopp"" kits. The leather is good, feels solid and well stitched, but you can also get them in a slightly less expensive PVC leatherette version. You can also find these in some stores although the ones I found were double in price. Sometimes the bottoms are leather and sometimes the bottoms were a beaded plastic. Frankly I made sure to get the beaded plastic as it will last longer than a leather bottom. The key features if this Dopp kit are: 1) Construction feels solid. (Although the tag says made in China...you would feel better if it had a proud to be made in the USA tag...however, I don't think this is an issue here.) The leather and stitching feels strong. The zipper is a hefty enough piece of metal that will last. The leather handle is small enough that it fits under the fold of the kit's side if you do not want to use it. The inside is a traditional liner with a single razor pouch, however, the liner and pouch feel like they are made of a newer composite plastic material than the older plastic liners these type of kits used to have. The liner feels stronger and I doubt it will rip, which often happened with travel kits. 2) It has Dopp stamped on it, on two flaps/tabs. The tabs are aesthetic choices but look good and remind you that you have a ""real"" Dopp and not some random ""Men's Toiletry Bag.""  There are newer types of ""Dopp"" kit's out there made out of nylon mesh. If you like that I would recommend something by L.L. Bean or Swiss Army. But for something more traditional I would only recommend this brand right here... Outstanding",4.0
"I didn't buy it on Amazon but I have one and had to relate this.  I make a lot of short and long trips and keep mine in a garment bag, but unfortunately that bag has a bad zipper.  My black Dopp bag fell out onto the middle of a city street late at night.  I didn't realize it for several hours, and went out to look for it.

It's now January 2017 and this Dopp kit has held up amazingly well he uses it on an almost daily basis to carry his toiletries to the gym, and packs it into our luggage whenever we go on a trip, and it doesn't look any worse for the wear. The wide top which stays open is very convenient especially when there's a mix of large and small items. It's also structured and feels like a quality product in hand, and doesn't get crushed when thrown into a bag.

I anticipate this lasting for many years to come, which makes it an excellent value. (Dopp, would you guys make this in some more colors so I can grab one too?) Almost 3 years and still going strong",5.0

"Purchased this on January 2015, and i gotta say this worth every penny i spent. I was looking for a simple, understated travel kit with no extra compartments or embossed logo on the exterior, and this is exactly what i want.

Pros:
- Feels and smells like genuine leather, smooth leather. (It's better to use leather care lotion once in a while as mine has started to show some creases, probably due to hot weather)
- Neat and strong stitching along the bottom, the opening, and the inner artificial fabric (see photos)
- Bottom material is made of waterproof artificial fabric, wide and hard
Cons:
- I wish the inside pouch were slightly bigger, with a zipper so stuff won't fall off, and can store more stuff
- Holds less and more expensive than my Nautica travel kit (see photos)

Overall, it's a great product, and with little ocassional care i'm sure this will lasts for years. Classic sophisticated dopp kit",4.0

"I had a Dopp Kit in the early 70's when I was a teenager and somehow lost track of it.  After wearing out the plastic travel bag I've had since then, I wanted to go back to the classic Dopp.  The Admiral did not disappoint - it's a great travel companion!  The sides are a nice, soft leather, the bottom a vinyl which is appropriate, given that the bag will be placed on wet countertops.  The stand-up top stays open for easy retrieval of essentials then securely snaps shut; the bag is closed by a heavy-duty zipper.  Inside the bag is a water-resistant liner with one side pocket for small items. The Admiral Dopp is really lightweight but very well made and stows nicely in an overnight bag - a handsome, high-quality, timeless design.  It's a pleasure when the small things in life work well. The Admiral did not disappoint - it's a great travel companion",5.0

"I bought this for my 8 1/2 year old son.  The helmet itself was huge, can fit an adult with no problems. Because of this, it basically ""floated"" on my sons head. As for the face protector working by a touch of a button and the electronic recording, these were the selling characteristics. BUT, too pricey for not having enough positive things to balance out the negative...not enough to keep a childs interest.  My son enjoyed it the first couple of days but has not picked it up since. I also think if it fit better, (had a padded plactic skull frame inside for a snug fit) it would rate better and people wouldn't mind paying the asking price so much. It's o.k. for a child who enjoys space and astronaut themes.",3.0

All of the kids thought it was a great finishing touch to his costume with the automatic visor and sounds.  The only down side was the weight and bulkiness of the helmet.  My son felt it was too hard to walk around in, so he carried it most of the time.  It's now a great decorative touch to his space themed room, that he can pick up and play with from time to time. All of my son's friends loved this.",4.0
"This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price. Not a good value",1.0
"I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult.  I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably!  While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable.

Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours.  The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter.

I know this wasn't really made for me though, so not going to take a star away or whatever. For an affordable addition to my Halloween costume, it's good. Great quality, though might be too small for adult costumes",5.0

"We bought this for our (small-for-his-age) 4 year old for Halloween. It was a little heavy for him.  He only wore it during our trip to the Target for their pre-Halloween in-store event. He was the talk of the store.

This fits onto an adult. The talking inside the helmet is not too loud. The edge of the stickers started peeling off the outside of the helmet within the first day but could probably be fixed with a dot of super-fast drying glue.

"I bought this for my son because he loves dressing up like an astronaut.  It's very big and it actually fits my very large head (my head is slightly too large for the last setting on most adjustable caps).  It also seems to be pretty durable as he tosses it around like it's made of steel.  Because it fits me, I have to dress up like an astronaut with him by putting on the helmet, but that's just a plus in my book.  The visor spring latch is a very cool function.  The blastoff sound is the same countdown over and over and is a bit repetitive, but I can overlook that because of the other cool features. Really nice astronaut helmet",5.0

"Came on time, in a comically huge box. Overall, an overpriced piece of plastic junk. The seam down the center is crooked and the parts on front weren't even snapped together. This would be fine for something that cost $5.00. Amazon sells it for over $20.
 One button opens the visor, but this function broke almost right away. Another button does nothing but cause a loud, low quality voice screaming a countdown, followed by the sound of a ROCKET BLASTING OFF. I should point out the speaker is inside the helmet, right beside the wearers ear. It does this at top volume and the only way to stop it is to take it apart.

We have now received the new helmet and are very pleased with it.  Aeromax toys was very kind and professional, and I am impressed that they reached out to us.

The sound volume is perfect - too low to be annoying and just right for the wearer.  I think this is one of those presents that will hang around for a while. Oh, one negative thing - I'm not sure it really is negative - The face plate fell off after a few hours of tough play.  Now normally I would call that a bust, but not in this case.  I like the way the plate can be reattached - but I also like that my little astronaut isn't too confined. It's just a little piece of mind that he's not going to suffocate - I know it's safe - I just don't want to be that parent who find out in the emergency room that my little adventurer was the victim of parental stupidity. I think it's awesome. It's huge",5.0
It was worth the price! It is sturdy and held up to my son opening and closing the visor over and over. He dropped it several times (and tossed it) and I was able to snap the visor back on.

Looks good, speaker quality seems fine, sturdy visor.  Plastic a little thinner than I thought with a seam with clips running down the middle of the helmet.  I guess if it were heavier plastic it would be just that, heavy.  Will update after Christmas if does not hold up. Seems nice...",4.0
"I really like this helmet.  It fits both me and my 4 yr old without feeling claustrophobic.  The only thing that I don't like is the button placement.  When I bought this helmet, I thought the red, blue, and green buttons on the front would be the buttons that operated the speakers and visor flipping mechanism.  But I was wrong.  The buttons on the front are faux buttons.  The buttons to operate the speakers and visor flipping mechanism are on the side of the helmet towards the top.  The right button triggers the helmet flipping mechanism and the left button triggers the speaker.  My son has played with this helmet for about a month now and the helmet still works good.  The only thing that I'm concerned about is the visor staying closed.  It takes some finagling to get it to latch sometimes which worries me.  But it still works right now.  I'll update my post if it ever fails. Good Helmet for a Great Price",4.0
I wear it more than my son. He loves that too. This is great fun any time. This is great fun any time,5.0
"My son loves to play dress up and loves space, so I had to try this out! We bought it, the boots and gloves to go along w/the actual costume when he was 4 for Christmas. It's cute but pretty cumbersome. Doesn't sit still on the shoulders b/c nothing is holding it on, but still fun, little sister likes it too! It has a button that says stuff and the visor opens at the push of a button, thought that was pretty cool! For dress-up, it's fine, but probably wouldn't be fun to wear all night for Halloween as it would just bounce around uncomfortably while they ran from house to house. Cute but cumbersome",3.0
My son likes the helmet and will wear it with an astronaut costume for Halloween.  Con: The helmet is so big it actually fits my adult father and I will have to add foam strips to make it fit my 6 year old son better.  But it is still a good buy for the price.  The package was very easy to open. Good buy but really big.,4.0
pretty durable and my son doesnt mind how big it is I like it,4.0
I had purchased the deluxe version of this. ( my band is space themed and we are putting together a space suit for the drummer) this was the cheapest piece of crap for $30 the only thing I even ended up using was the visor and I stuck it onto an old motorcycle helmet and covered it in white duct tape. Under $5 Booooo!,1.0

"We bought this helmet for our 2.5 year old daughter who is obsessed with space.  It is a great helmet and she loves playing with it, but it is quite large. Even though we expected it to be a little big for our toddler, we didn't think it would fit us!  I can easily wear it with room to spare.  Very fun toy though. Great Helmet but pretty big",4.0
"I got this for my son figuring he can wear it for Halloween this year 2014. He is the recommeded age group. Even when I added a winter hat on his head. I will attempt to buy some sort of foam however he may be scared of the added foam since it will have to be very thick to take up the space in the helmet.

This helmet fits me and I am 49 years old.

Unless your 5 year old and above has a HUGE head I doubt it will ever fit until he gets to be of adult age.

Hope this helps someone make an informed decision. NOT FOR THE RECOMMENDED AGE",1.0
"My Grandson (age 3 1/2) loved the helmet.  He couldn't believe the sounds it made.
He thought he was a real astronaut!  The only problem was that it was too big.  The
fact that he was small, made the helmet sit on his shoulders.  My son said he would put
some thick foam in the top if he needed it.  My grandson loves the helmet! Loved the childs astronaut helmet",4.0

"My son loves this. My only complaint is that it can break if you raise and lower the visor manually instead of using the button, so might not be the best purchase for a smaller kid who might not understand that. Nice helmet, very cute",4.0
"I knew this item would be too big, but my 6.5 year old daughter loves it anyway. Sometimes the visor opens while it is being stored in the astronaut backpack.  Only has one recorded message.  Powered visor is a nice feature.  Both buttons are labeled on the sides with stickers, not sure how long the stickers will stay on.  NASA logo has been painted on the back of the helmet (not shown in photo).  Fake buttons on front are painted (so glad their not stickers).  Thick plastic, so it should be durable.  Helmet is two pieces glued together, I hope the glue holds.  My daughter is very gentle with her stuff so it should last a long time.  For the quality, I feel I paid too much, but compared to the other options that I could find, it was worth it to pay more for this and hope we can get 3 years out of it, versus paying less and getting 3-6 months. Very large just like others have stated",4.0

"This helmet is aesthetically very cute and is made of a durable plastic. The intercom has no volume control however, the volume is not too loud for a small child. My 8 year old daughter wore this helmet for Halloween.  As many others have complained, this helmet is too oversized for smaller children; I can fit my head inside the helmet and still have some room left over, with no problem. Even my daughter, looked somewhat like a bobble-head with the huge helmet over her head! But what is worse, is the push-button visor feature; it is impractical for a helmet that is labeled ""junior"" & marketed for children, to only operate with a pushbutton feature. The push-lock feature used to close the visor, should be the same feature used to open itnot a push button. As many others have stated in the reviews, this makes the helmet more prone to malfunction or to be easily broken if mishandled or dropped. My daughter only wore this helmet  for 24 hours on Halloween; after hours of pushing & releasing the visor/button all day, I carefully put the helmet back in the box. I started to walk away & heard the visor pop-up and release on it's own, in the box. After, removing the helmet from the box, I observed the visor would no longer work it was broken. I was able to return and exchange it with Amazon, hassle free. But the point is, it should not have broken after 24hrs use; that visor button needs to be redesigned as it is flawed & impractical. Cute but has a design flaw",3.0
"sadly, i choose to ignore the other postings about this being a very large helmut. my four year old was totally smitten once he saw the photograph of this and he was so excited to get it. it is HUGE. absolutely, unbearably huge. causes much frustration and sadness in my son. it is big on his dad. i tried to fit it with foam strips but that didn't work. it is just that huge. also, the price? really? way too big. much, much too big.",1.0
Very big and cumbersome.  My 7 year old son could not walk around with it and see where he was going.  I put in LOTS of padding and it still did not fit.  It sits in his room on a shelf instead of an active toy.  He did like the sounds and visor that moved. WAY TOO BIG!,3.0
"Looks really cool but my son couldn't wear it for long because it was so big. If it had a tighter feel on his head, he would have loved it. Too Big",3.0
"kids love it.  The speaker inside is cool.  I gave it four stars for durability.  The face plate doesn't always retract when you press the button.  It's approximately three years old & still holding up.  great purchase, I'd buy it again for a friend! great helmet, very realistic",4.0
"My 3 year old wears this almost every day, and has for the past 2 months. This helmet is fun, it is a little fragile although apparently more durable than it looks or than the box warnings indicate. (I do have careful kids.) It is pretty well made (except for the foam on the shoulder cut outs that was gone from the helmet in a hour) , It has a speaker that talks basically to the child/person wearing the helmet. The talking is VERY quiet -thank you helmet maker!- you can hardly hear it if you yourself are not wearing the helmet. This also means it is at a low enough output that it is easier on the ears of the wearer. Although at 3.5 years old it is a little big for him,y son really really likes this helmet- I am sure he would recommend it! calling all small astronauts- this helmet is for you!!",4.0

Way too big, not for young kids",2.0
"Perfect for 8 year old.  He has never had the luck of finding a costume hat/helmet that fit until this one!  It might be a little large for some children, but buy some weatherstripping from your local hardware, line the inside, and you will have a great helmet that will grow with your little one. Excellent quality Love",5.0
as does my 7 year old.  Like other reviewers have indicated...this think is very large and easily fits an adult (as evidenced by the adults who may have modeled it in our home).

I got this helmet for my nephews 4th birthday he played with it for a minute but it was a lot bigger than expected it turned him into a walking Bobble head it's best used as display due to the large size Oversized,3.0
"We ordered this for our son's 7th birthday, because it says one size fits all, and is designed for a child. However, this does NOT fit at all, in any way. It is HUGE! About three times the width of my son's head, and it does NOT stay on! It rolls off, or tips, no matter what he does. The front is so tall, that when he flips the visor up, the remaining white part of the front covers nearly his entire bottom half of his face...poorly designed and built, and definitely NOT build with a child this age in mind. My son still wants to play with it, but is constantly getting frustrated because it will not stay on his head. He has to walk holding onto it with his hands, for it to stay on...would not have purchased, had I realized this, and would return for a refund if it would not have been part of his main birthday gift. If he chooses to let it go before our time runs out for returns, then we will be sending it back, as I am sorely disappointed with it, and hate seeing my son so frustrated on his birthday, with an item that he has been wanting to get for over a year now. NOT good for smaller children, no matter what it says!",1.0
Got this for my nephews birthday. He is 4 and although it is large he has not taken it off since he got it. He runs around with it on laughing. I think it was a good value. I know my nephew is highly satisfied. :) My 4 yr. old nephew has not taken it off!!,5.0

Seller was great and shipped product promptly.  It arrived and was exactly as shown.  Product is a bit cheap though.

"We bought this as part of our son's Halloween costume. The product is called Jr, but I have to wonder what size of child they are talking about. It is HUGE. Our son had to hold onto it to keep it on his head. Honestly it was like he had a huge bowl on top of his  head. You have to put some serious padding in there and redesign the inside to get it to work properly. My husband and I both tried it on our head and it was still too big. The buttons and sound work, but not really well. For the price, it think it would be better to just create one out of paper mache. Not very good for kids",1.0

There is not a lot of rocketship stuff for that age so ordered it knowing it would probably be too big. Appears to be solidly constructed.

"Bought this helmet for my 8 yo son who wanted to be an astronaut for Halloween. He already had a NASA flight suit, just needed something to complete the outfit. This helmet complemented the suit perfectly and he really loved the functionality. The visor opens at the push of a button (spring loaded) and there is a speaker inside that plays some mission control audio when you push another button. Sturdy enough to play with it on and looks decent. It is large, an adult head fits in there, but this did not cause any issues. He loved it and was grinning ear to ear the whole time. The only con I see is the price which is on the expensive side. Overall I'm glad we purchased it and would definitely recommend it as a costume accessory. An awesome costume accessory",5.0
Ordered this for my son's Halloween costume.  Very good quality.  All of the kids at his school party were fascinated with it.  It has become a favorite dress up toy at home.

Everyone loved it, asked me where we got it from and my son just loved the attention.  Now that halloween is done, I'm sure he will continue to play dress-up almost daily.

The durability isn't all that great, as the microphone inside the helmet broke off the day that we got it....but that really didn't take away from the hours of fun my 5 year old son got from it.  It runs rather large, as I could easily put it on my head.  If you have a young one that wants to be an astronaut for Halloween (or just for dress up) this is a must have. Very Cool Helmet",5.0
"My son just received this.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is a good hard plastic.  Other than that... it was broken out of the box.  There is a warning in the box that if you manually open the visor it will cause the button to stop working.  Well, ours never worked.  The helmet is HUGE.  The manufacturer suggests adding padding to make it fit.  For a $50 toy, which is very large for the recommended ages, it could have come with a little padding like bike helmets do.
Now my son is throwing a fit that we are returning his new toy.  Thanks... Broken Out of the Box",1.0

"My friend and I found a broken one of these at a thrift store for $2. By broken, I mean nothing happened when you pressed any buttons. We were going to a paint party rave that night and were amazed at the costume piece we had found. The helmet was a huge hit at the party. Everyone wanted to wear it. At the end of the night, the owner of the club took it because it was so cool. Which means we no longer had a helmet. I just bought two more for a paint party this weekend. Hopefully no one takes them, because this is getting expensive. The point of this story is that this thing fits adults, is fun, and is enjoyable even if broken.

There is no way he could safely wear this at a Halloween party or running around trick-or-treating - he can barely walk in the house without bumping into something while wearing it. On the flip side, he does love it and feels like a real astronaut while wearing it so perhaps it will get some make-believe play use. I do have a problem with the price though. The quality of the piece appears to more in the $15-20 range than the $40 range. Overpriced!!!",3.0
"The helmet, though really needed to complete the costume, is very large for a child's head.  I can wear it.  However, if it were smaller it would have been too difficult for kids to get off and on. I think if you just padded the inside, which I will try, they will get it on and off just as easy but also wear it more comfortably.  Maybe the company could include such an offer since the helmet is already very pricey. Cute but pricey",3.0
It is not worth the money... Sound is muffled through a cheap speaker. The visor is cheap and falls off easy. Wouldnt buy it again.... Diffently cheap! Not worth it! Not worth the money :(,2.0
Got it for my 5 years old son. It's functioning OK but it's size is HUGE and make is cumbersome. It's OK but the size is too big!!!,3.0
"My grandson was so excited to get this.  We unpacked it and read the directions.  My husband checked out the mechanics and checked the button to hear the talking from space control and that worked.  Then he checked the button which controls the visor to go up and down.  It went up but not down now its stuck.  He opened the battery compartment and moved the batteries around but still nothing.....we are very disappointed.  We will try to get new batteries.  We can't return because my 5 yr old grandson, in his excitement to receive, smashed the empty box up.  I wouldn't recommend this item. The visor doesn""t work",2.0
"This helmet is durable, but is too heavy and large for a child to enjoy.  I would think that most children put it in their room on display...since they must enjoy space related items.  Don't purchase this helmet if your child wants to run around and pretend to be an astronaut....... Not really a toy",2.0

"My fiance and I knew that my little cousin Jack (almost age 4) was into space and decided to get him something little more unique for Christmas. When he took it out of the box, everyone thought he was going to be scared of it and wouldn't want to play with it. Boy were they absolutely wrong. He couldn't let it out of his sight. He looked so cute putting it on and popping open the visor ... lol ... this lasted at least 7 days. I'm sure his parents didn't appreciate having to take it back on their plane ride home after the holidays but they were definitely proud of him when he wasn't scared to play with it and I know they loved to see their son's creativity outlet through his imagination the way it did. I highly recommend this for young boys who have expressed an interest in space/the moon/etc. Great gift. Space Jack",5.0
"I am a professional space adventurer and can positively say that this product cannot be used in actual space expiration.  That being said, I am however in a space rock group. I bought this product for my band's super space jams.  The visor is a bit dark so I am unable to see my sweet finger licks through it, but it's cool because I can play with it up. If I would have designed this helmet, it would have a voice modulator and walkie-talkies...and then i would buy 5 and give them to all of my space friends. space lovers fantasy",5.0
"I purchased this helmet for my 9 year old son.  He picked it out on Amazon last summer but I was reluctant since I was afraid his head would be too big for it, since the recommended age was younger than he was.  When I finally did buy it, I was pleasantly surprised since it fits him with room to grow.  And he is a good-sized boy (not a small head).  It does instruct the owner to not open the front flap manually--to only use the button located on the side.  As long as the child will remember that the helmet should last for lots of play time.  Fun sound affects too!!  He loves it!!  It matches the astronaut suit, boots, and backpack perfectly; of which he wears all the time!! great astronaut helmet",4.0

"My 4- and 2-yr old boys both love to play Astronauts.  They gear up in their costumes and pretend to drive spaceships!  They were so excited about these helmets that they wore them for a good part of Christmas Day, and several times after.  The visor/shield goes up and down making it seem ""real"".  There are also sounds that play in the headset, but my kids were most thrilled with the working visor/shield.  The only drawbacks are that the helmet is generously sized...so quite big on children under 5.  Also, the box says to only open the visor with the button - but young kids instinctively want to push it up with their hands.  Although the instructions clearly say this will cause the visor to malfunction - ours hasn't broken yet (and it has been opened by hand more than once already).  We got ours on a special for $18. Great Pretend Play!",4.0
"The helmet really completes the outfit but I was kinda disappointed. I thought that it would change your voice when you talked but it doesn't. Also the visor keeps falling off. But overall, he enjoys it. I got a really good deal on this through Amazon and it serves its purpose as a play toy. Looks good",3.0
"My boys, now three and five, have been playing with this helmet for years: it's great for pretend play.  If you have a child with a vivid imagination who does not need a lot of battery-operated  noise to have fun, then this helmet is for you.  Assuming your kids are not deliberately destructive, then perhaps you'll find as we did that the helmet visor will be irreparably broken after 1 1/2-2 years.  The helmet is well worth the normal price of +/- $45 and is a screaming deal at $19,95: I just bought two! Great For Pretend Play",4.0
"WOW, what a realistic astronaut helmet. We purchased this helmet to go with our son's astronaut costume.  It was awesome!  He got so many compliments!  He really felt like he was a true astronaut. A dream come true for a day...priceless. The real deal",5.0
"This helmet is huge. You could have a head as big as Andre the Giant and still fit into this helmet. It makes my son (5.5 yrs, normal size) look like a bobble head. It is so big and clunky that he takes if off after half a minute. He does not play with it at all. We bought it for a Halloween costume (with the white astronaut suit) and the suit is really cute and realistic, but this helmet is definitely not. You can't even hear the sounds unless you are wearing the helmet, so the blastoff can only be enjoyed by the wearer. And that is the only sound, just a countdown and blastoff. No mission control stuff and anything else. Plus the flipping visor comes off a lot. My son has a great imagination and had more fun with a helmet we made from a box (before we bought the helmet) than he did with this helmet. Wish I hadn't bought it, but could not return it after I had opened it. bobble head",2.0
"My son has really been wanting this, and he says he's OK with it, but it's been sitting on the shelf since he got it. The mike broke off when he tried to rotate it. It's on a thing that looks like it should rotate, but it doesn't, so now there's no mike.

"We gave this to our budding astronaut for his 5th birthday - and he was ""over the moon"" pardon the pun!
He absolutely LOVES this helmet!
The price we bought it for, could not even be beat on EBay!
It completed his astronaut costume perfectly and now he feels like he is on ""real"" missions.
Highly recommend this product. Be careful not to let it hit the floor too much - it seems as though it could break if handeled TOO roughly.

Perfect for both boys and girls. Ready to Blast Off!!",5.0

"I bought this for my 5 year old son and it was way too big for him. In fact, it was a little big on me. I was expecting more out of the helmet and was disappointed that the noise it did make was muffled and hard to hear. I would not recommend this for children. Jr. Astronaut Helmet",2.0
"This was purchased for a 7 year olds school project and show. He loves it. The recording is realistic and adds to the pretend play. The hinge on the face mask should only be opened with a button, so I'm apprehensive about that breaking. We're tring to make it last until Halloween. Blast off",5.0

It was already broken. Of course, this is a foolish design anyway for child use, as a child will forget and try to open it manually. It's bound to break soon ..as you can see by other reviews, this has happened to several. And the replacement batteries are not normal batteries, nor are they located where the illustration says on the box. I don't know if replacing the batteries will help the face shield work...haven't gotten to a Radio Shack yet to find the specialty batteries. Very disappointing! Haven't even given to the kids yet. I wish I had read all the other reviews before buying. Since I also bought the space suit, I'm not sure what to do with the broken helmet. Expensive to ship back. Broken before using",1.0

My 4 year old son loves this helmet. It has a visor that comes down and opens and also a headset which has a recording. The only thing is my two year old got a hold of it and took out the padding inside the helmet. Made for maybe 3 and up. Great Fun!,4.0
"We bought this for our 4yo son, who is a bit hard on his toys.  In less than 2 weeks (more like 2 days) he has broken the mechanism that automatically opens the visor.  He loves the buttons, sounds, and overall he likes the helmet, but for a 4yo it is a bit big/bulky for his body.  He does like it, but it is not his first toy of choice, nor even his first costume/dress up piece.  He says it is good, and when he's wearing it he enjoys flying around the house.  Bang for the buck, maybe not at four, but it is a good fun item. Astronaut helmet with sounds for 4yo boy",3.0

"My nephew absolutely loved this helmet!

Exciting yet breakable",3.0
"The 3 year old who recieved this gift absolutely loved it but it was enormous!  It comfortably fit my husband's head!  We were prepared to deal with that by adding weather stripping as indicated in the box.  But, the visor broke 30 minutes after he (the 3 year old) began wearing it - and he was not being particualrly rough with it either.  If you're going to market something for children, it should fit a child and be sturdy enough to last more than 30 minutes.  It's such a great idea and compliment to the astronaut suit, and he did go crazy over it, but for the price, I am dissapointed in the quality of the construction. Great idea but poorly made",2.0
"My kids have a blast with this helmet but I'm surprised it was so expensive, I also thought it would make more sounds and have more features than it does.  It is also pretty big and heavy and can fit an adult's head.  Overall not worth it for the price. Pricey for what you get",4.0

I have used this hat twice now and I can already tell it it going to be my go-to hat for the spring and summer. I got the 24 month size for my 8 month old (she has a big head..over 40cm around) and I read the reviews stating to get a bigger size. It fits her head perfectly with some room to grow.

"When I received my ring, it was very apparent that it was made incorrectly. There was a huge gap between the diamond and the setting but only on one side. I contacted customer service to see if this could be repaired and was told that since it was a purchase over $300.00, I could only get a refund. I advised them I would be overnighting the ring back and would wait for my refund. After 7 days of waiting for my money, I received a ""repaired ring"" which ended up looking just as bad as the first one. It was the original ring that someone had poorly attempted to close the gap on the band. Not only was there still a gap, but now one side of the ring sat higher than the other. I immediately called customer service because I did not ask for another ring to be sent and explained that I had been waiting for a refund. The rep that I spoke to said he didn't see any documentation of a new ring being shipped or the old one being repaired. He told me that he would call me first thing the next morning after speaking to some of his colleagues to get this resolved. I waited 2 days and still had not heard anything so I called again. I spoke to a different rep who assured me I would have my refund the next day. I told her that I had already been waiting almost two weeks for this refund. She said she would put a rush on it but that never happened. I never did hear back from the 2 reps that I spoke with as they both promised to call me with an update. After waiting over 3 weeks I finally received my refund. My experience with Amazon was horrible. Not only was the product poorly constructed but the customer service department was no help at all. They made several promises that they did not keep and never made an attempt to keep me informed with the status of my issue. BUYERS BEWARE!!!!! Thank you for taking the time to read this...
M. Ebel My diamond ring experience",1.0
"My girlfriend was to say in the least very happy and excited to get the ring. Quite a few people were skeptical that I bought my ring from Amazon, but after a jeweler's appraisal all skepticism was satisfied. Jeweler appraised about 40% higher than what I paid. Extremely Happy Fiancee",5.0
"Dealing with jewlery salespeople is like dealing with car dealers.... misearble.  Using Amazon to buy the engagement ring was the best decision I could have made.  Such an easy process, such a great price, and the customer service was superb.  There was a slight delay in delivery (one day) and I had an email letting me know to expect the delay, and a refund of $70 for the inconvience.  The ring showed up looking exactly like I thought it would, my fiance loved it, as has everyone she has shown.  I would recommend getting your ring on Amazon to anyone I know. Makes it so very, very easy.",5.0
"I whish Amazon would pay more attention to details, when a customer pays $6K for a product. Remember that when I go to buy a ring in a store, the level of service is quite different compare to Blockbuster. You offer far more info on DVDs, then on a ring. I do expect actual digital pictures of the ring to be sent before the actual shipment in very high resolution.

The bad and very bad:

1. The proportions of the diamond to ring are not even close to the diagram.

2. 18K white gold is not even close to white, and you better have it in bold! Usually, rings like this are covered with Palladium, but not here.

3. Packaging is rather cheap. Would be OK for a $300 ring, but not for $6K

4. It was 2 days late. Once again, it would be OK with a DVD...

5. Engraving on the ring says ""Amazon"" in bold. It's not what I expected. So, have it in bold as well!

6. I do expect, at least, direct e-mail/chat support before and after the large purchase like this. Not just return policy.

7. Back to pictures. Usually, when you buy the stone in a store, you have an opportunity to look at the diamond with 10x magnification. So, I expect the picture like this when I select the diamond.

The good:

1. Having the scan of the diamond certificate is great.

2. Automated diamond search system is very good.

3. Looks like the craftsmanship is good. selling rings it's not the same as selling DVD",3.0

"My son loves these boots (he's 5). He thinks they're cool because they are snake skin (not real snake skin I'm sure, but he thinks they are). They seem to fit well and are apparently comfortable because he asks to wear them a lot, even with wind pants. He doesn't understand why cowboy boots just don't go with wind pants, or shorts, or anything but jeans. Happy son",5.0

When we measured the soles, these boots were the same length as his old ones, and the pointed toe makes them even smaller (his old boots were square toe)...

"These moccasins are adorable but everyone was right, they definitely run large.  I took a sewing measuring tape to my son's foot to measure and it was the exact length for the size 3, but when they came in the mail and we tried them on, there was definitely almost an inch extra between his toes and the front of the shoe.

I'm a fan of Minnetonka so I'll start off be saying that...however the string snapped but that was due to my mother strong arming the string to tie the babies shoe. It's great shoe just disappointed we can't let her wear them and on top of that I know that Minnetonka doesn't use good lasting material for these shoes that make (I've been wearing Minnetonka forever and my shoes either always have a whole in them by year 2 or the soles wear out by year 3).

"I absolutely had to have these for my child. I receive many compliements on them and they are soooo cute however functionality rates low.

"These are very handsome, well-made wingtips. I have recently become a big fan of Bostonian shoes, and I have always been partial to Clarks, anyway. They are quite comfortable, but do require some breaking-in. I wore them around the house for about a week before wearing them outside. They ARE stiff, but it is important to remember that wingtips are SUPPOSED to be stiff. The toe-cap and wings (longwings on these shoes) are there to make the shoe sturdier than standard oxfords. The stiffness will ease over time. These are clearly shoes that are meant to last. The leather sole gives excellent support, and the slightly padded insole makes these very comfortable walking shoes. The burgundy colour (""oxblood"") is beautiful, and the leather has a very nice finish. They run a bit small. I usually wear 8.5, though sometimes 9 with thicker walking socks. I wear a 9 in these with thin socks. Great shoes for the price",4.0

"Took a couple of days to break in where the shoe meets the ankle, but they are comfy now. I am a typical size 11, but these 11's were too narrow. The 11 wides are perfect, and don't have that wide appearance like other brands. I am on my third pair of blacks. I did not like the burgundy color, as they are too dark from my brown suits, to dressy for khakis, and I already have my blacks for dark suits, so they are basically worthless unless I wanted to wear them with a burgundy belt and blue suits. Not great winter shoes as there is no traction on the sole, but oh well. Great Shoes",5.0
"I have bought Bostonian shoes for years.  This is the worst shoe I have bought.  In fact the shoe fits so poorly and needs so much ""break-in"" I doubt I will ever where this shoe or buy another Bostonian.

Past Bostonians I have bought (including my previous pair of Bostonians)were made in Mexico and fit and felt much better.  I guess Bostonian shoes just what they use to be.

Be careful of Gabriel Shoes they said they have had a great return policy (when I bought through Amazon) and when I contacted them by phone after I had trouble with the shoes they said once the Amazon package has been opened  they will not take the shoes backs (even if they didn't fit and where not worn).

"Let me qualify this review a little, growing up my parents couldn't afford to buy me the fancy big box of crayons, you know the one with the built in sharpener and 128 colors? I was quite content with the 8 crayon package, but what happened as A result is that my ability to name colors is impaired. I can see, differentiate and appreciate color just fine, but I only know a handful of color names. Well, burgundy wasn't in my package of crayons so maybe he name of that color of the shoes I received was burgundy, BUT they were nowhere near the color depicted on the web site.

Now before any aspiring technologist points out my monitor may not be calibrated etc., these were not even close. These shoes were a pinkish purple, and had zero, none, not a hint of depth to the color. It looked like these were spray painted. I was replacing a worn out pair and I had to double take on these. I even went back on line to see if I chose a different color accidentally. These were terrible. The leather was very stiff and the fit ran small.

The photo shows a classically styled long wing tip shoe in a classic deep hue, these shoes were like a bad knock-off of what is shown! Burgundy? Not Even Close!",1.0

Then again, I am not surprised: I have another pair of Bostonians with which I have had a similar experience. These are durable shoes, so I'd say they are worth the wait -- and the occasional discomfort -- that comes with breaking them in. Bostonian Strong Wingtips",4.0
"**UPDATE** I bought a pair of these shoes in size 13, and the fit is great. No complaints about this shoe whatsoever...now that I've got a pair that's a full size larger than I usually wear.

This is my third pair of Bostonians. I have some captoes and some loafers of theirs and I wear them both all the time. I bought these wingtips in my usual size 12, and they are like a hundred-dollar torture device. It feels like someone's standing on my big toes while slicing off my ankles with a rusty knife. I can't decide whether to exchange them for a 13, or just go with a different shoe altogether. I was disappointed because I really wanted to love this shoe, and it ordered them for a special occasion. Another issue I have with them is that the finish looks much less natural than it does in the picture. They are super high gloss and super purple. MURDER",4.0

The shoe has changed and I found the stiffness unbearable.  I had blisters on my ankles within a few hours and within two days I had blisters on several of my toes.  I must note that the shoe did not feel tight in any way, but the stiffness and molding of the leather just tore me up.  BTW - I requested an exchange, which Amazon handled promptly, but the replacement pair were exactly the same.

"These shoes get the job done. If you don't have the money for a pair of Allen Edmonds and you still want wingtip oxfords, these are a decent alternative.

Mine began to have a very noticeable crease on the top middle area after a few weeks of wear. This is even when using shoe trees after every wear and polishing once a week.

"I chose to give it three stars because it does what it is supposed to do but it's not exactly what I wanted.

Well, it fits.  I can pull it all the way up to my waist, but it took effort.  Yeah, I know it is because I'm on the heavier side but I'm just telling you.  Okay so, it's not too tight on the crotch area but it's still tight enough to make me worry that it might rip if I move around too much. Another thing is that you can see your flesh color through the white stripes.  Oh and if anyone wants to know, around two inches before the crotch part of the tights, the stripes stop and it is just white.

I will say that if you are skinny, then these will probably work perfect for you.  Maybe it is just me but I'm a size 7 in jeans and this is just okay. Well, it fits.",3.0

"I bought these (in red and black) for my 11 year old daughter to wear as the girl from Hotel Transylvania. She is rough on tights, so I didn't rate them significantly lower for the run she got while wearing them to a Halloween party (indoors and only played video games/watched movies so she wasn't running around outside).

The good part was since she wears a size 2 to 3 juniors jeans (for the full backside she has) and the jeans are too long, these tights fit her without being stretched thin. So, when the run did happen, it was hidden well. If she had been adult size I believe they'd have been unusable  for actual Halloween. Run really easily, but don't show it",4.0
"two things: these were indeed green and white.  I wasn't sure since the picture showed black and white but they are the correct colors.  Secondly, they are great quality but they are a bit short.

"The ""one size fits all"" size description said 90-160 pounds, and I am well within that range and 5'8"".  They were way too short - the crotch was halfway to my knees.  I then cut the feet out thinking I might still be able to wear them with boots - but they were much too tight in the waist to wear comfortably or sit down.

"These are great shoes. When my son outgrew them, I grabbed them, and that was a few years ago. I am a (large) woman with wide feet, and women's shoes just aren't made as well as mens. These fit great, feel great, and wear extremely well. I'm pretty rough on my shoes, and with no care (I'm lazy), they still look great. I like the way they look. The only wear I see is on the soles (but they are very long-lasting), so I will probably be wearing them another 5 - 10 years! They aren't cheap, but you get what you pay for. In the long run, they are a real bargain, and when it comes to your feet, comfort, durability and common sense wins.

Another reviewer mentioned a squeak - mine don't squeak at all. In fact, that's one reason I wear them at work, my sneakers squeak terribly.

I also don't notice any leakage when I trek around in the rain and snow.

I love them! My son outgrew them so now they are mine!",5.0
"Incredibly comfortable shoes that age rather well.  No problems with them whatsoever.  They are very well made and long lasting.  I've had my pair for a year now and I wear them nearly four fifths of the time and they still look great.  These are great shoes for anyone looking for a classy pair of slip on shoes who are sick of the ""quality"" of cheaper leather loafers from other companies like Sketcher's.  But yes, as aforementioned, they will need to be water proofed.  But, so do nearly all leather shoes. Comfortable & Long Lasting",5.0
"Great shoes. I have never had any pain from wearing them -- I walk on concrete all day.  Unfortunately, I have worn them out after 2 years(no more tread on sole--I wear them just about every day), but I will buy a new pair; they are THAT good. Durable and comfortable...",5.0
"These slip-ons are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn.  It feels like I am wearing house slippers every time I put them on.

But a good mink oil will take care of this.  Sad to say I've just about worn my pair out (I wear them every day to work)...I'll be on the lookout for another pair to replace them!

"This is a beautiful ring- I had it as a purity ring for about a year and got many compliments on it!  However, it is frankly pretty cheap.  The metal soon got bent out of shape, and the CZ fell out after a year.  I really enjoyed it while it lasted though- it was only $10 so I wasn't expecting too much.  In short, its a gorgeous ring- but don't expect it to last too long! Beautiful, but breakable",3.0

The thickness of the ring seem just right, which doesn't make it uncomfortable to wear, and the width of the ring is not annoying-sized as you would see in some other rings. The design also is very simple yet not bothersome to the eyes (although in the contrary, very smooth surface and a pretty neat design); it doesn't stand out too much either, which is good in my opinion.

"I bought this ring from Amazon over a year ago.  It is still pretty, although very slightly worn out - as it usually happens with low-cost silver.
It am satisfied and I would buy it again.

The worst review here claims that this made her finger turn green and it bent within a week.  NOTHING like that happened to me.
Sterling silver is 7.5 percent copper which can turn green, and some people seem to have body chemistry that's prone to staining. This happens if a person is on the ""sweaty"" side and has a natural high acidity level. Another reason may be reaction  with lotions and some chemicals. nice ring",4.0

The cubic zirconia is cut just right and it is supersparkly and passes pretty well for a real diamond from afar. It seems pretty sturdy to me -- I have been wearing it for the last week and I am not a gentle person. The stone has stayed in place and so far, repeated washing of my hands with the ring on hasn't caused any problems. My finger has not turned green, and this ring is a cute little thing good for wimpy little fingers like my own. The price is great, and I would definitely recommend it. I'm a miser with my money and so I think this was the perfect purchase and it was well worth the small cost. I have no regrets. great ring",5.0

"I have had this ring for 2 weeks, of which I have worn it about 4 days.  There is no way this ring is sterling silver.  After the first day of wear, my finger turned green.  After the fourth day, it appeared so tarnished it was ridiculous and the ring has totally bent.  I almost couldn't get it off my finger it is so misshapen.  And before anyone asks, no I didn't wear it doing anything that would have caused it to bend.  I sit at a desk all day and type for my job and I am usually on the computer most of the night at home.

"I had a little shipping problem(no fault of the seller) and waited a long time for this ring.  I was disappointed when I opened the box. It looks cheap to me.  The setting for the stone is cheapo...not the band, but the metal the stone is actually set in. I've had it 2 years and have only worn it twice. It may work for a teenager. The band itself is nice and the stone size is small, just the way I wanted it. It has never tarnished. I know it was inexpensive, but it looks that way too....at least to me.  Gem Avenue does sell some of the best snake chains I have ever seen in sterling.  They are very durable and require little cleaning and they do not tarnish...period.  I had mine for 2 years  and wear them often.  They are inexpensive, but very well made and good looking. I really didn't like it",2.0
"I liked it, until the stone fell out. If you look at how the ring is constructed, the stone is just sitting between the two metal arms. That mean if one gets twisted or pulled, out goes the stone.

"I guess you get what you pay for. The buckle is as cheap as they come and the sizing is off.

I measured my thighs with jeans on and they were 1/2"" smaller than the high range of the size I ordered. The chaps came in and they stopped about 3/4 of the way up my thigh. The zipper starts at the bottom so there was no way to get any additional slack. I got the chaps a day before leaving on an extended vacation and didn't try them on until returning home. By that time, my window for returning them had elapsed. I now have chaps that I will only be able to wear if I loose some weight. Rock design Buffalo leather motorcycle chaps.",2.0
I am very satisfied with the product.  I did notice that the belt buckle was a bit cheap but overall the product is great. Great Price!,4.0
I hoped to wear these chaps for a Halloween costume and the sticking was falling apart from the start.  I am going to have to buy a new set or do a lot of repair to make them last one night.  I would NEVER wear these on a motorcycle.  If the leather and stitching can't hold up to my living room they won't do anything in a crash. Junk product,1.0
"The mens V-Creeper 509 is a surprisingly comfortable shoe. I owned 2 pair back in my punk/goth youth (yes, the 80's) and as much as I loved them back then, they were never that comfortable.

"Well, this is the first time I've ever bought shoes online and I suppose it's always a gamble, as far as getting the right size is concerned. Luckily, I took a look at Demonia's website and I read that they say that people who haven't bought Demonia shoes before should know that most people find that they have to take one size larger than their usual size. So, I ordered one size larger than what I usually wear and when the shoes arrived they fitted me perfectly.

Otherwise, the shoes also look great and are surprisingly, very comfortable. They look and feel tough, like they'll last for a long time. I wanted slip-on creepers and these were the only slip-on Demonia creepers I could find. The detail is also cool.

This is a great product.  I like the illuminating hands of the watch and the protective cover. Good quality,5.0
"I wasn't expecting too much watch for this price but from the other reviews I thought I'd be getting at least a good deal. I was wrong.

When you pop out to set the time, the minute hand flops around a teenie bit so when you set the time you have to be careful how you click the set knob back in or it can move the minute hand a little. Not very accurate and really annoying to me.

However, yes, it's fine for the price I guess but I'm now looking for another pocket watch. It's not worth it for me to send it back so I'm donating it to a thrift store and spending more money this time for something with a bit more quality. It's okay",2.0
"The face of the watch moves around when you change the time. I also found the stem would pop up while it is in my pocket. That allows the time to stop. The chain is cool, but the craftsmanship is clearly sub par. It is real light and obviously cheap. Not very well made",2.0
"this is a gorgeous pocketwatch, the brushed exterior and the swirled interior of the case are a nice touch, and the face of the watch is simple and functional.  my only gripe would be the chain. it broke off the watch after about a week, cheap metal and latch.  not that big of a deal, as usually just keep the watch in my pocket anyways.  good watch, would definitely buy this again. beautiful watch",4.0
"A simple and elegant pocket watch, simply put. I was a bit concerned before i made my purchase, as they do not show what the cover or its inside looks like, or even a good enough close up of the face. I was more than satisfied when i actually had it in my hands.

The inside of the cover is like brushed steel, with circle patterns and the face looked nice and simple, with a second hand. The numbers were easy to read and included military time in smaller red font beneath it, as well as minute conversion in small black just above them. It made it easy to tell the time at a glance.

My only qualm is the chain isn't a little bit longer and doesn't have a replaceable clip at the end. Good Price, Good design",4.0
What more could you ask? Great price. Large readable face. Stylish. Second hand. Easy to set. Get one and start a retro trend in your area. great watch for a great price,5.0
"This was such a great buy for me. I used wear a heavy watch on my wrist and it would get in the way of my typing and other things. This pocket watch took all of that trouble away. It's a great product, and the price if outstanding. Beautiful and stylish",4.0
"I just received this beauty and WOW! I coupled this with some stackable cz and tanzanite rings and I must say, I couldn't BELIEVE how real and gorgeous it looks! WHAT A GREAT DEAL! Definitely recommend it for those of us who love the look and can't afford the real thing. Awesome!",5.0
"I bought this ring recently and the stone and setting is gorgeous! The ONLY thing that I don't like it the flatter shape band. I like a raised band on a solitaire but that is a personal preference and in no way reflects the quality of the item. For the price, I would highly recommend!! Very Believable",4.0
I really like this buckle and it adds another dimension to my wardrobe.  Well made and generates discussion.  A good addition to one's wardrobe if you use detachable buckles. Celtic Big buckle,4.0
"This buckle is hot!!!  This design although popular makes a very unique statement. It is made of a great quality pewter, so it is durable and qualitative. On the back of this buckle there is sticker that says,

""This is not a toy."" The points on the sides that make the cross are wicked sharp! Not sharp like a blade, but, if the right pressure is applied, it could cause harm.  So be careful.  This buckle, although small can work for any style or personality.  Get it, you'll love it!!! Great Gorgeous  Buckle",5.0
"The bag is comfortable to wear, watertight, and has bunch of compartments to hold your stuff. I especially like the two front side zippered pockets, very convenient. The main compartment has a pocket that will fit a 13"" computer, though it can accommodate a larger one simply by putting it in the main compartment (duh). Jansport bags are usually very good, and this one is not exception. Great bag",5.0
"This bag is very spacious and holds a lot of stuff, enough that I can even use it as a weekender bag when I'm not using it as a daily book bag.  For anyone who, like I did before buying this bag, wonders whether it's suitable for laptop storage, the main compartment has what the manufacturer describes simply as a ""divider,"" but which is padded on all sides, so it makes for a serviceable laptop sleeve.  The bag has an ample number of intelligently-designed pockets for keeping organized everything from little stuff like pens and post-it notes and such, to mid-sized pockets suitable for holding items about the size of a paperback.  It has an elasticized mesh side pocket that offers quick and easy (i.e., unzippered) access to stuff like a water bottle, a small umbrella, mp3 player, cell phone, keys, etc..  The ballistic nylon is seemingly indestructible - it has successfully resisted a number of attacks from my springer spaniel - and sheds rain easily.  All in all, a very versatile, dependable, and well-thought out bag. Great product",5.0
"I had an older messenger bag from Jansport that i unfortunaltey lost along the way. This seemed to be a suitable replacement. It is a little large for my tastes. I guess they make adequate space for a laptop, but I don't need it for that, for the most part. Pockets are certainly big, the grab handge is a little narrow, and thin. A little more color would be nice, because it is all black, with the exception of the logo being outlined in red. other than those minor complaints, i do like it. knd of plain",4.0
"This is a roomy, well-made and sturdy bag - my big gripe with it is that there is no handle, just the shoulder strap.  For some reason, there is a thin, flimsy strap at the top which looks like it could be used to hang the empty bag on a coat hook.  I don't see the point.  I like this bag, but assumed it would have a standard handle like all of the other messenger-type bags I've owned.  Makes it diffifult to carry at times. where's the handle?",3.0
"I bought this bag for the Jansport name, which, as a student and a teacher, I trust.  I intend to use this bag for a trip across Europe, then to use it as a laptop bag.

Good points:
-the Jansport name and guarantee.
-Water bottle holder on one side of the bag (great for me in Europe, and a key factor for me buying this bag)
-decent, if not great, laptop protection
-good size--can hold a lot of stuff or a little bit of stuff without losing shape or look
-comfortable to wear on shoulder or across body
-good length of strap (and it's adjustable)

Bad points:
-the flap is held down by two small, unadjustable latches.  I've found them difficult to use one-handed, and they just seem flimsy.  I'd much rather have one heavy-duty latch.
-The shoulder padding is a bit awkward...but it can be removed, and I think it will improve as I break the bag in.
-The smaller pockets in the front are not that great in design.  If you lift the flap, there are three pockets in the front of the bag.  (There's also a large zip pocket in the flap, which is good for easy access.)  Anyway, the center pocket is OK...nothing too fancy, but a zip front and requisite card holders, key holder, etc.  Above this, there are two narrow pockets that are a few inches wide and go down the whole front of the bag (thing a tall, thin rectangle behind the main front pocket on either side).  These pockets are pretty much useless to me...they're too thin for much stuff, and they're awkward to get to for easy access.
-The material seems thin.  However, since this is a Jansport bag, I'm trusting it will hold up. Some design flaws, but overall good",4.0
I think that I was misled by the picture that was posted on the website because I don't think the bag that I received looked like the picture. Disappointed,2.0
"This bag is absolutely perfect!  I keep my 14.1"" laptop, usb mouse, battery charger, palm pilot, palm pilot keyboard and random paperwork in this bag, and it is NOT overstuffed!  Everything important for my daily travels fits in this bag, and still looks stylish with the slim fit pockets!

There is a wide foam pad that I lay my laptop against, and I have nothing to worry about as I carry it along while shooting pictures.

The construction is the best, but then again, it is a Jansport, so you should already know that you have nothing to worry about in that department.

I would highly recommend this bag for laptop and business paperwork carrying. The PERFECT fit!",5.0

"I used to own this bag in the lavender/purple color but gave it away because it wasn't the most professional looking bag (although I regret it because the color was so cute). When I realized I needed a new bag I went looking for the purple one I had and then realized it was gone. Immediatley I wanted to order the same bag as it is comfortable, has adjustable straps and easily carries a ton of stuff. I keep my work laptop in it as well as my wallet, makeup bag, books, notebooks, and pens for grad school. And after all of that, there is still enough room for more. The black and gray colors of the bag I recently purchased look professional yet young and trendy at the same time. I would recommend this bag for anybody junior high and up to adult hood.

"After looking at quite a few reviews online, I decided this would be the perfect bag for me! I am currently studying ASL and so I have to take my current semester books and often books from other semesters to class with me. The size is great, the shoulder strap is comfy, the pockets are wonderful and the drink holder on the side fits my 20oz travel mug with no problems.

HOWEVER - I have a basic Toshiba 15.6"" laptop - IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE BUILT IN LAPTOP PADDED POCKET. I was pretty bummed. I almost returned it. Luckily, I had recently purchased a tight fitting slip lap top case and the bag is big enough that if you don't mind not using the pocket, the laptop fits. I recently took it to a study group with my lap top in a case, 2"" binder, 3 workbooks, a note book and my planner and everything fit just fine (along with quite a bit of things in the front pockets.

I had stupidly assumed that because my laptop is a fairly standard size and the bag got so many reviews about it's large size, my laptop would fit. If you don't take your laptop around with you often or if you have a smaller laptop (or a tablet), the bag is fantastic. If you plan on always having your standard or larger laptop in the bag, I would look elsewhere. Huge - but still doesn't hold laptop!",4.0
This bag is very well made. Large enough to carry everything I need to have with me. The straps are padded nicely so that it does not hurt your shoulder when you are carring it. Zippers are sturdy.

"PROS:
1. Many compartments inside and outside bag
2. Can be used for many purposes, as the material is very durable.
3. Minor wear-and-tear after three years of ownership
4. the shoulder pad is adjustable for all ages and sizes

CONS:
1. They should make more of these items for children, such as Walt Disney, as once this product is in the family, everyone is going to want one

RECOMMENDATION:
I recommend this product for anyone looking for a backpack, travel bag or utility bag. I use this bag for college, for work and when we go camping. It has really took it's fair share in beating and still stands it's ground. The material has not ripped in three years, and barely has minor wear and tear.

Great if you're going to carry around a laptop &/or books constantly - but if you're not, might be a bit too big for a notebook & water bottle...

"I needed a new bag that was smaller and had a strap.  The big issue with this bag is the laptop compartment! Maybe I missed the description but my 15.6 hp laptop will not fit in the laptop compartment which was a huge disappointment, but it worked out okay I instead put my iPad in there and I bought an extra neoprene sleeve for the laptop.  I need to be able to carry both for the program I am in and work.  In addition to a laptop and iPad, I need room for books and this bag is suitable for how many I carry.  The side pockets work great for cords!  Overall a decent bag, its a little thin and the strap connections concern me a little for how much weight it will hold but for 38 dollars I am satisfied with this buy. Its okay",4.0

"I love the bag, not too big, not too small... I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't provide measurements in the description so I had no way to determine if my laptop would fit in it... I brought this bag and my laptop both at the same time from Amazon and took the risk of it not fitting because it isn't that urgent that I take my laptop with me everywhere... I have a Gateway laptop that measures 15.02L by 9.96W according to the product info... It fits in the bag, just not in the laptop compartment... Its just barely too big to fit, maybe by half an inch, but it can fit in the bag so I'm not too worried... It's a very good quality bag though, exactly what you would expect from Jansport... Great bag",4.0

"I purchased this Jansport messenger bag after years of using the standard strap backpack. Considering the amount of wear and tear that I gave the said backpack, it was in considerably good condition. Thus, when I decided to search for its replacement, I looked among the Jansport brand. When I saw this messenger bag's style, I was instantly attracted to it. After receiving it, I was pleased with its appearance and its functional pockets and compartments. The only downside to it is that the strap isn't well cushioned, making it a bit uncomfortable when carrying anything over 5 pounds. Overall, this messenger bag/tote is a great value for those interested in upgrading from a standard backpack. Stylish and functional",5.0
"I've been using this bag for a couple of years now and as others have stated this is a pretty large bag which can be a pro or con. It has a sporty look and now I use it more as an overnight/gym bag than an office bag, but it served me well carrying around books and folders for years. While the storage space was nice, some parts of the bag haven't held up well. Within the first year the water bottle holder made of mesh broke. Also it doesn't have a true handle, rather a small strip attached to the back which you can use if you need to grab the bag quickly. This broke and it gets annoying when I just want to pick up and carry the bag briefly. Lastly this bag doesn't have much padding for laptops, and while it does have a compartment, I would recommend getting an additional sleeve.

Pros:
-Lots of space
-Versatile
-Durable main compartments

Cons:
-Might be too large for some people
-Water bottle holder broke
-Laptop compartment not very padded

Overall it's a good versatile bag, just be sure you're okay with the size. Lots of storage space",4.0
"This bag is perfect. The layout of all the pockets and storage areas just ""makes sense"" and it has enough pockets to hold everything that I need.

"good bag. strong, roomy, and nice looking. but there's one problem. shoulder strap becomes twisted when used. the strap's attachment to the bag should have been able to rotate 360 degrees and not stationary. why this wasn't done is beyond me and thats why it received 2 stars. its a headache constantly straightening the strap out. good bag, but",2.0

"Been using for a week for morning commute and so far its fantastic. It's roomy enough to cary: a laptop, laptop power cable and mouse, large thermos, three ring binder, a portfolio, a thick book, and a box of Kashi bars all with some room to spare. The strap isn't fantastic and it usually starts to slide off of one shoulder so I wear it across my chest. Quality is good, it's sturdy and durable and so far nothing is fraying or coming appart. The style is nothing amazing but for $30 this bag has a lot of utility REAAAAAALLY BIG",5.0
"Its just as said in the product description, Jansport does have very strong bags, so durability is a plus here.

"My 9 y.o. daughter was clear - she wanted a messenger bag, preferably in turquoise with at least 3 pockets.  This bag fit the bill perfectly!  It has 3 large pockets which all close with heavy-duty zippers.  The largest pocket is big enough to carry a 3-ring binder, lunch bag, several books, notebooks, folders and a jacket.  There are several smaller pockets internally for pencils, small notebooks, phones, etc.  The handle is broad enough to not twist easily and can be adjusted to fit shorter or longer bodies.  She has only used it for 3 weeks but so far, it seems like it will hold up well throughout the year and she loves it!  The bag we bought is mostly turquoise with a bit of white near the bottom.  It is not the plaid one shown in the photo. Sturdy and cute bag",5.0

The padded shoulder strap is comfy even though the bag is heavy when full.

"I originally got this bag about 6 years ago (in 2003). It was perfect, there were so many little pockets that you could organize everything you needed. Plus, it doesn't look huge, but it holds ALOT of stuff.

I purchased another one for my boyfriend recently (Fall 2008) b/c he was so in love with my bag. The design in generally the same, but the quality of the material has seriously deteriorated. You can tell the fabric is made of much cheaper stuff. The front zip pocket use to have a compartment to slide things into, but it now just sown directly onto the bag (eliminating a good partition in front pocket). There is also this tiny piece of fabric sown on as a 'handle' to use to carry it, but it's so feeble, it's not really much of an improvement.

If you didn't know what the old one was like, I'd still say it was a pretty good bag...nice colors options now too, but clearly cutting back on the quality of the materials and workmanship. JanSport quality is definitely going down...",3.0
"I purchased this bag for my partner who is pursuing college. He absolutely loves this bag. There are a number of zippered compartments on the body of the bag. The front flap also has a small pocket for easy access externally which, is secured by clips that attach to the bottom of the bag. Beneath the flap is another zippered compartment that is very handy. It has a number of pockets, a key ring, among other areas to keep yourself organized, this zippered area provides a secure place to carry a  wallet or music player without having the worry of being pick-pocketed. We live in Chicago and this is a wonderful commuter bag as well. The strap has an adjustable pad for heavier loads as well as a padded back for wearing while biking. There is also a netted external pouch for bottles. The main compartment of the bag is secured by a long zipper that runs the length of the opening and also has a padded divider for occasionally transporting any size laptop. It was money well spent, as he'll be sure to use the bag for years to come. I hope this helps in your decision. Elefunk Messenger Bag",5.0

I love this ring because it is believable that i could actually afford a diamond ring like this one and no one would think twice. The ring shines and sparkle beautifully.

Let's be real most of us on Amazon looking for a nice deal for our buck well this ring you can't go wrong for the price and on Amazon an upgrade is ssoooo easy to do when we're ready. Just think at these prices an upgrade can be done yearly. If you like change like i do this is an ideal way to purchase wedding rings. Spending 800-1000 on rings you stuck with the same look for years the average working Joe I'm speaking of. That same money i can change up at anytime and not feel guilty about money.

The ring itself is great for the money. The stones have a nice shine to them. There may be some manufacturer defects like mine arrived with a small chip on bottom of band and the center stone is set on a slant but nothing noticeable from a distance.

"!!!!BUYER BEWARE!!!!!
When I received this set, to say that I was disappointed, would be a gross understatement.  I was disgusted!  First of all, the ring was damaged/defective (whatever you want to call a mess up).  The center stone was improperly set and positioned within he prongs.  It was crooked.  And I assure you it was extremely obvious.  It didn't take any close inspection to see.  It was glaring.  Then the prongs themselves were also bent down in mismatched places on the stone, one being bent straight down the side edge of the stone vs. pointing relatively toward the center.  This only added to the overall impression of the stone being crooked.  It made the stone look as if IT were misshapen and cut wrong.

I get that you can't expect fake jewelry that costs $30 to be the same quality as the real deal... But this?  It looks like it came off the $5 carousel at walmart.  And frankly, I wouldn't have bought it from there, for that price.  It looks like crap.  It looks like a gumball machine ring, or something that could have come out of a little girl's dress up set.

Now, even had the prongs been set properly, etc. I still wouldn't have worn it.  That just added insult to injury.  The ring, had it been in perfect shape, still would have looked like something from the dollar store.  It doesn't look anymore ""real"" than a peice of glass stuck in a plastic band.  The silver even looks funny. It looks like tin foil. The reflective sheen is a dead give away.

The stones don't look like diamonds at all.  They don't even look like good immitations.  They look like cheap junk.

Also the center stone is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to large to be believable. On anybody.  It's about a 3-4 ct. stone.  It looks absurdly fake.  So unless you think that your friends might actually be able to bring themselves to believe that you could afford a $15,000.00 ring, then ummm yeah it'll be too big.

And if you can pull that off, then maybe you can also convince them that you know, all good metals are as shiny as tin foil, too.

Don't get this ring.  Don't waste your money.

On one side the band is straight where it connects to the center stone, and the other side is more curved. The center stone is a tiny bit crooked, but no one will really notice unless they are seriously studying it or if I point it out. Other than that the rings are gorgeous. Much nicer than I expected them to be. I have gotten so many compliments and a friend of mine didn't believe that they weren't real. The sizing was right on.

"We purchased this set to be my wedding set as we are low on cash and I did not want something expensive for fear of losing it, etc. This set is absolutely beautiful! I absolutely love the setting, and the cut of the CZ. To me, it doesn't scream fake, but if you get close to it and really want to analyze it, you will probably be able to tell its a CZ, although I think it sparkles and shines just as well or better than some diamonds personally. The only thing that I think could be a little better is that it could be a little more scratch resistant, but that could be the plating as I have had other sterling silver rings that weren't plated that didn't scratch as easily. Gem Avenue is a great seller and extremely helpful and quick in response time and shipment! I will buy from them again! if you are looking for a great looking set at a great price, this is your set!

"After looking at rings for a wedding set for about 4 months I finally decided to purchase this set. I received them and they are perfect. Since they were such a cheap price I didn't expect them to be this nice. I wanted somethng that I could wear without having to worry about freaking out if I lost a stone out of one or banging them around when working. I am very picky, my husband says I have a little bit of OCD. I was concerened that the center stone would be to big and look fake or that the other stones would be so small you wouldn't be able to see them at all. I also was worrying about other issues that I had read about on reviews of other rings. The Size, the center stone being lose right out of the package, the stones turning black or quickly falling out. I had also read the review on this ring that said that there was a little gap between the rings because the center stone on the engagement ring was not set up high enough to let the rings nest together. So I was very anxious to actually receive the set in the mail and try them out for myself. They finally got here and I was VERY surprised to say the least. They were perfect. The stones were just the right size, not to small but not big enough they looked fake when showing people. The women at my work thought that they were real. All of the stones were secure in their settings and they are still just as sparkly now as when I took them out of the box. I wear a size 10 ring and its hard for me to find nice rings in my size. When I Took these out of the box and put them on they fit perfectly. There is a TINY gap between the rings but it is VERY TINY (so tiny I can't even think of anything that would fit in the gap between them, maybe you could get a VERY tiny knife blade between them but that s about it.) and not noticeable to anyone other than the wearer. I am VERY pleased with this purchase and I will be ordering from this seller again! Just Right",5.0
I was truly surprised when I opened the pretty little silver box with the pink bow trimmed in silver and saw these rings! They are beautiful! And I haven't stopped smiling since. They give me joy every day! I have seen sets for a lot more money that didn't begin to compare with these. I ordered a size 5 and it was a perfect fit...I am very glad I decided to order these and I definately will be ordering again in the near future. Love this set!!!,5.0

"I was looking for another ring to take the place of my lost wedding ring.  This ring was actually the second one I'd ordered, and I wish I'd seen this one first!!  The ring is beautiful.....!  I wanted something that would not look so gaudy, and this is the one!  I have small fingers and need something kinda small.  I wish the setting for the stone sat up a little higher, but it's still pretty on my finger.  My husband loves it!  There are small, unnoticeable flaws on the stones (i.e. a little separation between the stones).  Overall, I am absolutely pleased with my choice, and I have already recommended this manufacturer to my friends and relatives!!! I LOVE MY INEXPENSIVE, BEAUTIFUL REPLACEMENT!!!",4.0
"The rings are both very pretty and fit together nicely. If you look closely, the setting for the center ring looks cheaply made which gives the ring away as being fake, but for the price paid I think that is fair enough. On the upside, the smaller stones are very nice without any gaps, something I was a little worried about. Overall I'm very satisfied with the buy and it does not scream FAKE as some CZ rings do - the center stone is a nice size and the cz's used look nice. We will be putting off buying a ""real"" wedding set for a little longer since this set is so pretty and I like wearing it. The shipping was also fast and the company replied very quickly when I had a question. Very Pretty",4.0
"Upon opening this ring, I thought, ""wow, this is beautiful!"" And then I took it out of it's cute little box and my heart sank. It was lighter than air, and felt like it was made out of plastic. I wore it for the day, took it off that night, and realized that it was scratched where the stone on the engagement ring meets the wedding band.

I am sadly disappointed in this purchase. It was cheap, and now I know why. I was unsure of whether or not I actually wanted a fancy diamond wedding set, and this answered my question, at a very inexpensive price. I now know that the traditional wedding set is not for me. I'm glad I purchased this ring first before I purchased something far more expensive.

At a glance the ring is beautiful. If you don't mind feeling like you are wearing a plastic ring, then go for it. I for one need something a little more substantial and will be purchasing a Robert Lee Morris ring for my wedding ring. Is this actually plastic??",2.0

"I had to buy a replacement for my wedding set due to pregnancy swelling, and this item looked the closest I could find to my real set.

The only reason I rated it a 4 instead of 5 was because the center stone should be set up higher to allow the two rings to nest.  Due to how the prong is set, there is a small gap between the rings when they are placed next to each other (again, something no one else but the wearer will notice). Worth the $",4.0
I have purchased from Gem Avenue prior to this purchase and have been very pleased with each purchase.  These rings are more stunning in person than in the photos for the ad.  They sparkle and shine no matter what I seem to get my hands into.  I haven't had any of the problems some of the others have mentioned other than the minor sizing problem which is easily fixable.  Gem Avenue is a great company to work with and will work with you until YOU are satisfied.  They have quick response to problems (I had a very minor one) and are very fast to attend to such errors.  I'll continue to be a happily satisfied customer. Excellent product from fantastic seller,5.0

I did not have an issue at all with the sizing.  I wear a six and ordered that size in this ring and it fit perfectly.  This is a beautiful ring.  The diamond is not too big and not too small.  My original wedding set is yellow gold and I was looking for something that would go with the silver jewelry that I wear most often now.  Perfect addition to my collection. Would highly recommend.

This is a very beautiful ring set. The delivery was also quick. I ordered on Sunday and got them on Thursday!! I also ordered a size smaller and got a perfect fit!

"This item looked like the perfect replacement for my worn out double wide card holder. All reviews were good. Well.....no longer! I have two problems that make this item unusable for me:

1. The height dimension is just a hair bigger than my old insert. This means the new one extends a bit above and/or below the wallet dimension.  And....

2. The reason for this extra height is that the cards insert from the top, rather than from the inside, protected, end of the card sleeves. This means that if you drop the wallet, the upper stack of cards could easily come shooting out. Nothing to stop them.

Im not sure how to say this costume fit. Its a one piece that is stretchy. The top is velvety and doesnt fit well at all for someone with a smaller bust and waist. The skirt part was totally fine and kinda silky. The cape fit too tight around my neck. The belt also didn't look right since the torso of the costume wasn't fitted to me and the belt would sit weird. I didn't try the boot things since the rest was too weird I figured I would leave it wrapped. I think if I had a more shapely body it might look better or if it had a zipper to close like a glove. Not for my thin body,2.0

"I got this for my nephew's superhero birthday party. It arrived promptly, well packaged and all the parts included. I read other reviews that say this runs big, and the chart provided online has measurements included. I typically wear a size 10 or 12, so I ordered the M. It did fit perfectly. More snug then I would want but not indecent. The gold belt included in my package was actually a size Small,  so I had to get creative and pin it to one of my regular belts just to use it with the costume. Very Nice!!",3.0
"I hate to leave a negative review (""if you don't have something nice to say..."") but this was such an awful costume I feel an obligation to warn others.  I needed a Wonder Woman costume asap so I paid to get it expedited, which was almost 1/2 the cost of the outfit.  But the dress arrived and was made of such an awful material and so unflattering that I ordered another - paying MORE in shipping than the cost of the new outfit.

The red top was made of some sort strange puffy rubberized felt that buckled and created a lumpy look.  The skirt was a billowing sticky plastic.  The leggings that create the thigh-high boot effect have no way of staying up on your thigh, no elastic or anything, so they just slide down your leg.  And the cape's Velcro around your neck is extremely tight without any room to loosen it.  I ordered a medium and I'm a thin person but it was sewn to fit a kid.

Look, it's alot of work and material for a very low cost and I could understand cheap workarounds to keep the price low but it's super unflattering and unworkable. Very Cheaply Made & Unflattering",1.0

"Good costume for the price. I purchased a size small. I'm 5'2"" and weigh 125 lbs. I am larger in the bottom and smaller up on top. The waist and skirt fit fine, but I was not able to fill the top too well. The back of the top has plenty of extra fabric (I didn't need it) but the elastic worked well to hold the top up. I wore a bra with clear straps and the top stayed on just fine. You can see in the picture that the top sagged a bit. That part of the costume (the top) is lined with a thin layer of foam. If purchased in advance, it can be altered to fit better. The boot covers did the job. I held them down over my shoes by using clear bandage tape. The cape is adorable, but I must have a big neck because it was a bit tight. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase. I got lots of compliments on the costume. Wonder Woman",4.0

"The costume is ok at best. The top was fine although shorter than I hoped for (I'm 5'10 with even proportions), but the skirt is awful. The sewing was done haphazardly and there were several places with the skirt bunched up in the seam and the fabric looked terrible. The pleats at the center were completely off center too. I took the skirt off and reattached it so it laid smoothly and was even. The skirt had several places where the blue was coming off because the material is cheap. If it got snagged on something or was pulled at all it would turn white and look awful.
Order down a size or two. If you're on the larger end of what each size will fit, order down 1 size. If you're on the smaller end of each size, go 2 sizes smaller.
I'd prefer straps on it even if they're clear or any way to keep the top up better. Because it fits such a large range there is a TON of elastic on the back and if you're not pulling it tight it doesn't stay up and had an unflattering fit.
The boot covers are poorly made too. I have big calves and they were too big on me. They won't stay up and there's no real way for the cover to stay in place. There's only an elastic that's supposed to go under your shoe but that doesn't work because It attaches with Velcro on the bottom of the shoe so you're stepping on it the whole time. The only way to keep this in place would be to spray glue it to whatever shoes your wearing. You're better off buying the actual boots which look awesome. Too bad I saw them too late to get here in time.

"So disappointed. So many issues. Too small, somewhat melted together upon arrival, and quality is very poor. Many of the reviews on here suggested going a size down because it apparently runs small. This was not the case for me. A size down made it near impossible to get on. And unfortunately there ware no fasteners or zippers in the back, which would have been extremely helpful.

The material on the bust is awful. Super scratchy/itchy material. Very hot and uncomfortable. The skirt bunches at the top, so it's kind of a mushroom shape down there. Not flattering at all. When I opened my package all the material was slightly melted together as well. Pulling the pieces apart from one another resulted in discoloration.

The tissue paper somehow managed to stick to the tiara and can't be peeled off of the star. The cape stuck to the skirt too and when I peeled the cape off, the color came off the skirt AND the cape.

"As everyone has noted, the costume runs on the larger side. I am 5'8'', 150 lbs, usually wear about a size 8. I'm a 34C. The dress is made of foam and polyester, and the skirt was nearly melted together when it arrived. There is no way to iron the dress, as it has to be kept away from heat for fear of melting. The folds where it was stuck together had to be pulled pretty hard to get them to come apart, and the skirt was discolored where it had been stuck together. The bodice is pull on (or pull it all over your head), rouched in the back with elastic around the top, in the back only. The bust is too large for a C cup. It is made of a very thick material, so if you slouch a little, the material bulges out and it looks like I have big rolls.

"Since other reviewers said this runs large, I ordered a medium and it was about right.  I would consider myself to be a long-torso person, and the top of this is still a bit too long for me.  I wish there was a good way to make it a bit shorter so that it doesn't bunch up and create the illusion of tummy rolls, which I have recently worked pretty hard to eliminate!  Overall, I have made the fit quite good, but I did remove a piece of elastic from the inside of the back of the skirt that was about 6 "" long so it pulled the skirt to the point of being so tight it hurt.  Removal of that piece and the skirt hangs very nicely and the torso fit pretty well.  The top part is definitely designed for a well-endowed person, so I had to take in a few inches there as well.  The belt was a bit tight, so I moved the Velcro over to make it fit.  The cape Velcro was positioned weird so that it scratched my neck when attached, so I moved  one piece 90 degrees to the other so that the neck attachment actually forms a ""V"" point, which I believe is how it is supposed to look.  I am currently shopping for some boots to wear because the boot covers are a bit of a joke compared to the rest of the costume, which is pretty decent quality.  Overall I do like the costume, but I would say that chances are quite slim it will fit anyone perfectly right out of the package.
My top is the fuzzy covered foam material, and the skirt is a shiny polyester.  I did buy some biking-type shorts to wear underneath for comfort, with the blue and white star pattern than matches almost perfectly.  The skirt is a good length, but still a bit short for a 50 year old woman going out in public. Pretty good after some simple alterations",4.0

This is a great Wonder Woman costume!  I'm so glad I read the other reviews before ordering.  I normally wear a size 18 or a size 18W and took the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a size down and purchased the size Large.  I also purchased a pair of blue and white star shorts to wear underneath since I felt the skirt was too short.  The top and belt fit perfectly too.  I will try and post pictures later this month when I wear it to a Super Hero themed birthday party. Size Large Wonder Woman Costume,5.0

"Based on reviews I thought I'd better order an XS. But the problem I ran into is that while the bust area fit, the waist is a little snug. So while I don't think the Small would have fit at the bust portion, I have to rate this less. Also, the top does slide down because the ribbing does not hold it up long term. And the wrist ""gloves"" do not fit correctly around your arm. I will wear this but am going to upgrade the accessories to make the outfit look better. Jazz it up and it'll look ok",3.0

"Love it! Skirt is a bit long (I'm about 5'3"" 155 lbs.), so I will be hemming it.  I got a size medium but measured a size large.  One flaw is the boot covers do not stay up at all!  I had to put rubber bands on each boot at the top by my knees, to hold the boot covers up.  Then the toe part keeps sliding off my shoes.  So I bought the actual wonder woman boots to wear instead. (not pictured) Other than the boot covers being horrible, the costume is very comfortable and cute!  I can't wait till Halloween to wear it!  The picture is with everything that comes with the costume, the boot covers look cute but do not stay up, it wasn't too bad with the rubber bands at the top but then the foot part would slide off as I walked around.  This would be very annoying all night at a party. Very cute!  Runs big and boot covers do not stay in place.",4.0
"To consider the number of stars I would give this, I had to take into consideration the various components of this costume.  I am 5'6"" and 135 pounds and ordered the small costume, and it fits nicely.  Here is my review:

The bodice/skirt: the main piece of the costume consists of the bodice (top) and skirt, which are connected.  Overall, this part of the costume is pretty decently constructed, and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.  The bodice is a velvety material and has some stretch and structure to it, but I noticed other reviews mention a zipper.  Mine did not have a zipper, so I had to pull it over my head and hope not to stretch it too much.  It fits pretty snugly, but does not provide chest support, so it would most likely have to be worn with a strapless bra or bustier for a little more structure.  I am a 34D and the small provided enough coverage.  The skirt is cute, a shiny blue material with gold stars, not much else to say about that.

The knee-high boot covers: terrible and unusable!  The tops are not tight enough and sag, and the bottoms hang loosely and won't completely cover boots.  I won't wear them with this costume, and I might try to find an alternative.

The belt: fits nicely around my waist/hips, although just barely.  I could see if someone was more curvy, the belt might not fit. The belt would be better with a little stretch to it or some elastic in the back.

Arm cuffs: while the rest of the costume has gold accessories, the cuffs are silver.  They are very basic and loose on my forearms.  I will wear them, just so I have something on my wrists, but I might spray paint them gold.

Head piece: will work just fine!  It is as pictured and wraps around the head and fastens with Velcro.

Cape: lightweight and fastens around the neck.  The Velcro fasteners are a little scratchy on my neck, but it's a costume, so I expect a little Velcro here and there.  Thankfully, the cape helps to hide some of the imperfections of the bodice.

I should mention that I had to exchange my costume for another in the same size because the bodice of the costume had some weird bulging on the sides that made it look like I have rolls under my arms and on my sides.  I haven't received the replacement, so I hope it will be sewn a little more carefully. Overall a good costume for the price, with some design flaws.",3.0
great looking costume for the money.  its not too short so i can wear it to work without flashing my goodies.  the top is loose so I had it taken in(size 12 top/large/ 36DD) but the hips fit my size 14 curves so I got the large. saving the day looking good,5.0

Packaged Nicely. It was a bit wrinkly. And had to tape the boot sleeves to soles of shoes because it rode up exposing shoe underneath. It was very skimpy but appropriate for a wonder woman costume.

"After reading reviews, I ordered a small. I'm 5'5, 137 lbs, & a 36D. I'm a size 6 but hour glass shaped. The dress fits good. You will definitely need a push up bra or something because it's not real piping and is a velour cover more than a bodice. The skirt is short as expected and I will be wearing some type of boy short or something underneath. The belt does not fit at all! It fits my head and is essentially the same length as the head band! The silver arm bands are fairly cheesy. Almost look like they belong to an astronaut costume. I think I may try to make my own if I have time. The boot covers aren't great. They are really long but could be tucked in. The material is transparent but on top of boots, that wouldn't matter. I don't think they will stay on though as there is no elastic in the toe to keep them in place. There is a strap that goes underneath, but it was still loose for me. I think I'll end up spray painting a pair of boots I use for costumes anyway. The cape is made of polyurethane foam, it seems like it all is, but will work fine. I ordered this for my sons 6th birthday as he wanted a Halloween birthday party. All in all I think it's cute & will work for what I need with some minor modifications. Dress and cape are good, accessories pretty cheesy.",4.0

"As per the reviews, the fit is really big, but oddly proportioned. I'm 6 feet tall and typically wear a size 12. The measurements for the large size costume seemed accurate, but the fit is way off. The corset/bodice is huge and better for someone with a DD chest. There is elastic around the back of the bodice, but the entire back panel sags, making the skirt fall uneven. The neck opening of the cape is very small too, and the velcro fastener closes too snugly. There are large tags and strings everywhere that need to be snipped. The arm cuffs are also super wide. I'm going to try and have a seamstress sew up the sides a little and try to make it fit instead of attempting to return this. I'm really disappointed with the quality, workmanship and value for the price. It's not worth it. Take your chances, buy some fabric from a craft store and try sewing your own outfit - you would probably have more success. The corset/bodice is huge and better for someone with a DD chest",1.0

"You really do get what you pay for. This garment is awful. I get that it's a costume, but wow. The top is velvet with like a foam backing, so it adds thickness to your sides and waist. Last time I checked, women don't want to appear THICKER than they are. Plus, the back has an elastic across the top and then it's loose in the waist. The fit is horrific. I'm a large in women's clothing so I ordered a Medium since I read they run large. It was still huge on me. I ended up having to cut it up and modify it so I could use the skirt.

I ordered this bases off the reviews. They were helpful but I should have never ordered this item. This is great if short skirts are what you like. I'm a pear shape and this doesn't help out either. I'm much smaller on top. I'm a med on the bottom and a small up top. So over all the skirt was to short for my taste and I just didn't have enough upstairs to hold the darn thing up.

"I was skeptical about purchasing this costume after reading some of the reviews, as it was about 50/50 good and bad. But I ordered it anyway and the costume is actually perfect. It looks exactly like the picture shown. The boot covers are velvet red with white stripes. The skirt portion of the dress is a shiny blue material and the top is also a velvety red corset with a stretchy back. I am 5/9 and weigh about 125 lbs and and a C-cup and the small fit me perfectly. I normally wear a size medium in tops but after reading that this costume runs small I went for a small instead of medium and the fit was great. The skirt portion was also a good length, short enough to be sexy but not too long.

"I ordered a small, which is what I normally wear (size 4), even though the other reviews said to order a size smaller because this costume runs big. I figured that it would be better to have it big and be able to have a tailor take it in. I am glad that I ordered a small! It was a bit snug, but it did fit. I am 5'9"" and weigh 143, I have a 34"" in seam and am average bust size. The dress is a velvet type material (no wire in the bodice area though) and the skirt portion is a satiny type material. The skirt was a good length (still sexy), even though most of the time being so tall skirts are too short. The head band was a bit big and the silver arm cuffs didn't fit quite right. The boot covers were fine, where as the reviews I read said that they were really loose. Order this according to your actual size! I would say that this costume would fit a girl perfectly that is very busty, very small waisted and not too tall ( maybe 36- 24-34 measurements). On the positive side, it arrived really quick (within 2 weeks)! For the price, $35, I'd say it's worth it. Small sized Wonder Woman costume",4.0

1. It was NOT the same costume, the materials are not the same, the quality was poor. I went to a costume store and found the exact one pictured here, the materials were completely different from the one I received in the mail.
2. The sizing was WAY off. I am a 10/12, and according to this sizing chart, the large should have fit without issue. This costume was so small, I thought they had actually sent me the wrong size. But, the tag reads ""L"".  I could not even attempt to put it on, it was literally that tiny. However, the one at the store fit just fine in a large. SO, I am returning this item.

"The costume was great.  I wore it for an event kicking off a local library ""super hero"" reading program for kids.  The library couldn't find a Wonder Woman costume for me so I bought this one myself, and I fit in fine with the rented costumes other people wore.  It was nice because it was modest for the kids at the bust and skirt (the woman's chest in this picture isn't how you'll look unless you're using some major duct tape).  I ordered smaller because the reviews recommended it - I'm a 36DD, 32"" waist, 40"" hips, and always a ""large"" - but the medium fit perfectly.  As others said, the ""boots"" are pretty worthless, but I knew that going in so I was prepared with other boots.  The quality is good enough for parties and such, and the price was great. Great Wonder Woman Costume",5.0
"Loved being wonder women for Halloween. I work at a elementary school so super hero costumes can be used often. ESP the cape. The whole costume was of good quality and the cape didn't hurt your neck as it velcroed behind your neck and had padding in the front.

Overall I loved it and would consider buying another costume from this seller. Love it, great quality costume!",5.0

"The costume fit pretty well.  I'm 5'6"", about 165 and I was able to fit into a medium pretty well.  I have large hips so the skirt was a little less than flattering with all of the pleats, but overall, it was good.  The belt that comes with it is really big, especially if you have a little waist.  The boot cover things don't stay up unless you have something to attach them to but they look alright.  The cape and the other accessories are a little cheesy but it is what is expected for what you pay.  The top part of the costume is a foamy kind of material that does stay up well.  It can bunch up along the sides though.  If you have a larger chest, I'd recommend a strapless bra to go with it. Well made, one piece costume",4.0
"Super fun. Got lots of compliments. Very bright! Definitely runs large. I'd normally get an XL in off-the-rack costumes, but after reading the reviews, I got a large, and even that was a bit roomy. But I worked with it because a medium would probably have been too small. Wore a boned corset underneath. Necessary, as the bodice has no real structure--just an elasticized pull up. But I was going to wear the corset anyway, so that worked fine for me. Cape is a bit tight around the neck, as some have said, but wore it all night and it was okay. Boot covers were loose and didn't stay up very well, but made it work with some wardrobe tape. Only thing that didn't work at all were the armbands...they are HUGE! Ha ha so ridiculously large. So I just did without them. But overall it was a big success. Bright and fun and lots of impact! The hit of the evening. Super fun!",4.0
It was perfect! I wore it in a half marathon and it stayed up perfectly with my sports bra. I got a small and I'm a size 6 with a D chest.

The body part looks the same but the belt is a different material, same material as the arm bands, sorry I don't know what to call it. I didn't wear the arm bands because I had my own better ones. Head band is a good one, looks good with the outfit. Clearly the description says you get boot covers, not the boots in the picture, but they resemble the boots. I wore them over jeans and had to pin them, but they looked good enough for me. The cape part around your neck is different from the picture and was tight on my neck, kind of irritating, but it looks good with the cape. The top red part with the ww  was really bunched up on the sides. I couldn't pin it to fix it or anything. I wore a sweater over it because I wore it to school so it looked ok, but I wouldn't wear it out with just the cape. Maybe mine was sewn funny. Skirt was nice looking, shiny.

"I took note of the reviews when I ordered this and got a medium instead of a large. I am either a 10 or a 12 in most items, so I was torn as to what size to order. I have a slim waist but I 'm curvy and I also didn't want it to be too short, so I got a medium thinking that would be the right size, since it would be a ""Big Medium,"" which is the size I would normally wear anyway.

I should have gotten a small.

The bottom half of the dress fit fine, but the top was baggy.  I wear a DD cup so this is not usually I problem I encounter, but the issue lay in the fabric the top is made out of. It's velveteen on the outside but the lining is this awful foamy stuff, presumably used to give the top more structure.  The top fit okay through the chest, only a little loose, but because it was cut funny it was very bunchy through the waist and the foam lining only made this bunching more noticeable. I could grab an handful of the elasticized portion in the back, it was very loose.  If they had nixed the foam lining I could have altered this to skim over my curves better but alas, the stiffness of the lining made it too hard to pin attractively.

It made me look like I had rolls because of the way it bunched at the waist.  Definitely buy the smallest size you think you can get away with to avoid all the extra fabric.

Otherwise a good costume.  I didn't wear the bootcovers because I wore red tights instead but everything else was at least okay. I liked the shine of the skirt. I just wish it fit better.",3.0
I loved this outfit and got so many compliments on it!!

"Got this costume for my daughter (5'8"", 180lbs).  Bought the medium, had to be taken in by a seamstress about 1 1/2 inches from each side.  The material is elastic and feels a little flimsy, but for a couple of wears, it'll do fine.  Top feels velvety, skirt plastic.  Beautiful, lively colors; ordered Prime and got it in four days.  Skirt was decent length for such a tall girl, but since the material from this part is so flimsy, she'll probably wear it with some kind of short-shorts in case it rips of the wind gets a hold of it.  Overall, a bit expensive judging from the quality of the materials it's made from, but happy with the colors, length of the skirt and the fact that it doesn't dive and show too much cleavage.

"This costume is so nice!! My only problem is limited to the reviews claiming this costume runs large -- what??! I am 5'3"" and 115 lbs - I comfortable wear a size 2. I ordered the xs based on the reviews, and it is too tight!! And it arrived today, day before Halloween, so no time to order a size up. I'm going to have to hold my breath for hours tomorrow but it will be worth it because this costume is very cute!

My advice: order your normal size (or better yet, a couple of sizes and just return what doesn't fit) Awesome costume, great quality, NORMAL sizing",5.0

"Bought for a friend who is about 5'5"", she is a 36 DD and typically likes to wear baggy XL t-shirts.  (She is on the demure side).  I talked her into this costume and it looks great on her!  As she is larger chested, it doesn't want to stay up, being that it is strapless.  She added nude colored straps which help hold it up, and isn't noticeable.  Also, the gauntlets are large, so fitted them with some velcro to sinch tighter.  The boot covers don't want to stay up, so added a small string of elastic around the top to keep them up over regular boots.  The cape neck is way to tight.  The costume runs a little short, so jazz pants or shorts are recommended.  All in all, a really cute costume for the buck!!!  : ) Nice costume for the price.",4.0

"I loved the look of this costume.  The boot socks did not fit well for me and the top was a bit loose, although the neck strap for the cape was too tight.  With a few modifications the costume worked out well though.  Certainly worth the price.  I did choose to purchase a metal tiara and cuffs separately.  The ones that came with the costume were felt and rather cheap...I didn't mind though considering the costume was so inexpensive to begin with. Great costume!",4.0
"Well, after patiently waiting a little over a week for this costume I go to try it on, expecting it'll fit perfectly, and it fits SNUG. I'm 5'1"" 120 pounds and this thing is SO tight. I was a little disappointed and regretting that I didn't get the small. But I'm still most likely going to wear it. The quality is great. Everything about the costume is what I expected it to be and more besides the size. A lot of reviews were complaining of it being too big but I suppose it depends on how you are wanting it to fit. I was hoping for more length I got as well. But it is an adult costume so I suppose my order is exactly how it's supposed to be. Everything I wanted and more but trouble with sizing",4.0

As with the other reviews, the boot covers could have been a better quality (one of mine ripped when I was putting it on) but they aren't as bad as the reviews sound.

"I bought this costume at a Halloween store in town and got a size small. It was a bit too big in the back area, too much loose fabric. I ordered an XS from this seller, and it came quickly. It is a well made costume, and it fit my body type perfectly. I am 5'10, weigh 155 lbs with an athletic, muscular shape. I have 34DDD chest and my waist is about 27"", with large butt and thighs. The XS fits like a glove, it makes the girls look AMAZING! I would recommend ordering a size smaller than what you normally would. If you don't, you will probably have to take it in. There was way too much extra fabric on the size small. The cuffs are a shiny silver neoprene material, they look ok but I got real gold metal cuffs that I will be wearing instead. The skirt is short but I'm going to get some Wonder Woman boyshorts and that should solve the issue. Overall it's a great costume, definitely worth the money. Just remember to order a smaller size!

"The seller got it to me just fin- no problems with them- but the costume is not up to par. The top is not satiny as appears it is more terry cloth/ felt looking/ feeling. the arm bands do not look or fit anything like the picture either- they are foamy and not at all tight fighting, the collar for the cape way too small (and I do not have a large neck) and the boot covers- which I did not expect much from- are made of felt and are so big I can't pull them up.

Actually the costume itself is pretty nice for what it is.  The bust is really big so the top half didn't fit.  I'm a size 14 with a 38D bust and it was loose.

"First of all this is an excellent costume for the price - I was mostly sold on the fact that it came with the boot toppers (the other one I was considering did not). However, I'm not a fan of the velvety texture of the top part. And the top part is actually somewhat large on me, however, the skirt is a little too short for my 5'9"" height (that's a common costume problem I have though). I will still be wearing it though because its a decent costume, just those minor issues. Decent Costume",3.0
"I read reviews before buying this and everyone said it was horribly large and didn't look like the photo. Well I found this exact costume at my local halloween store and tried it on.

"Bottom Line: the quality is pretty poor. The skirt is basically plastic. It just wasn't well constructed at all, even for the price.

I thought I could potentially pull this off for my son's super hero birthday party since reviews stated the skirt was long and the boot covers were pretty high. However, the top is very large and wouldn't stay in place. The neck to the cape was tight and uncomfortable. The skirt was awful and made my hips look about 3 times as big. It just was not good - not for ANY occasion.

I bought a Wonder Woman t-shirt with a cape that I was much happier with and the party was a hit :) Poor quality",2.0
"The bodice is lined with a weird foam stuff, so it was necessary to wear something under it for comfort's sake. Overall, the costume is pretty decent quality, apart from the boot toppers.

The boot covers were better quality than I was expecting, they were a velvet-type material, and large enough to actually fit over boots.

The overall appearance of the dress is nice and hope after fitting it sewing somehow it will be okay, however, the boot covers, belt and head band are ridiculously cheap looking and huge as well.

"I bought this for myself.  I am a size 10/12 and 36C - the large is way too big.  It puckers on the side of the bodice and the chest is very loose fitting. The top has elastic in the back so it would probably stretch to fit a size 14. The skirt has a lot of gathers, making my bottom half appear larger than it is, but the belt fits snugly with the Velcro matching up.  The boot covers are a tad snug on my calves so they will stay up.  The headband fits and is nicely subtle.  The armbands are fine, although probably hot as they are made of a rubbery vinyl.

"I was happy with my costume, overall, but as for long-term wear...not so much. I had to wear this costume about five times for a production. There were a few things I noticed to be issues. First, the blue color skirt faded somewhat quickly. That was disappointing, as I needed to wear it several times. I wouldn't have expected color fading. The boot covers were ridiculous and I didn't use them at all as they didn't stay up and were quite bulky. The cape was quite tight around my neck, and I consider myself to have a neck of average size. The ""bracelets"" were poor quality and I ended up purchasing metal ones.

Wish they had a better way to keep those up (or you might make a mod yourself) and this outfit would be a 5 star.

"I loved the costume, but it was HUGE! I read all of the reviews prior to purchasing the costume and many people said the sizes ran large, but I told myself that I would rather buy something that's large and alter it then be stuck with something that doesn't fit. So I looked at the size chart and selected a large based on the measurements they put down for the bust. It said that the large would fit those with a bust size of 38-40 inches, but the dress was falling off of my chest even though I wear a 36DD. It was also way too big around my waist and hips. I personally altered the dress and took in approximately 2 inches from each side (total of 4 inches). I also had to alter the wrist bands because they were a total of 3 inches too big for my wrist. After altering everything, it looked great on, and everybody loved it. But I suggest if you're purchasing this costume, buy a size smaller than you would typically get, and save yourself the trouble of either altering it or sending it back. Way too BIG! Buy a Size Smaller! (Needed to be altered)",3.0
"The outfit tends to run big and also stretches, so an extra large will fit anywhere from 14-20 probably. I am average breast size, and I took mine to a taylor to have the sides of the breast area taken in, so if you are larger up top, you will have no problem fitting into this one. The downside for me was that the outfit is very square, and I am hourglass shaped, so it made me look ""boxy,"" although everyone else thought I looked perfect. It's plenty long and is made of good quality, considering it is a halloween costume. The extras that come with it (crown and arm cuffs) look cheap, so I recommend getting the gold crown and cuffs that another distributor carry. The boot covers are great if you already have a tall boot to wear them over, but if you're foot is larger then a 7, you will have a couple inches of your actual boot showing at the toe, which isn't really a big deal. Overall this outfit is great for the money, and for a few extra dollars, you can get the crown, cuffs, and wig and win that costume contest. its great",4.0

I'll pair it with nude fishnet hose and some red heels. But be aware of the size issue. I always get a large in halloween costumes and I haven't had anything be so big on me.

I can just about fasten it.  The skirt however, is too full and way too long.  If you have long legs this might be ok for you... at 5'3"" the skirt is so long, it comes down over the tops of the boot covers.... and there is so much material gathered for the skirt, it comes off kind of bulky.

"The ""dress"" part was fine, and sized relatively appropriately I think, as is the cape. However, the wrist bands I would be hard-pressed to fit on my four year old. In fact, I think they are smaller than the mini wonder woman outfit she has! I will definitely have to pull them apart and put some velcro closures to make that work, as they have no give to them, and ripped open the first time I tried to squeeze them past my petite hand. Secondly, the ""boots"" are not as they show in the picture, a sort of vinyl texture. They are actually a faux velvet to match the top, and definitely not sized even remotely for an adult. I understand I have a size 10 foot and that may be unusual for a size 6 woman, but I wonder if these things would even fit a size 6 foot, and even if so, they would never stay up anyway. Another reviewer called them leg-warmers. Yes, after about 5 seconds, they are around your ankles. Ended up buying boots to replace that.

"The colors are vibrant, the general construction and quality were just fine for the price, but the sizing is so wrong.  I had read other reviews and knew to order the smallest size I could, so I got the X-Small, and it was still too big.  I am 5'5"" weigh 122 lbs, and have a 32D cup size.  Normally, I wear a size 3, 4 or 5, but I would say that the X-small actually fits like a 7/8.  I can keep this strapless costume up, but barely, and it is way too big though the bodice.  I have notified the company that sent it, and they have politely responded, and I am considering going down to the teen size or altering the size that I have.  Either way, just know to order a much smaller size than you normally wear. Beware of Sizing",3.0
"Outfit for school activity a perfect fit (x-small). I like it very much. Suggest underpants should be included.
Boot cover does not  fit properly, should have elastic to keep them up. A great WW outfit",4.0
"The cape was missing on this costume, even though the packaging states it comes with one.  The upper portion is made with foam, so if you use this in a warm climate, you will be hot.  I tried it on for about 10 minutes and was burning up.
The wrist bands were very tight (and I am a petite woman) and are not tapered.  It's hard to tell which side goes toward your elbow.  The ""boots"" are socks without a bottom, and there is no way to keep them on your feet or a shoe.
It looks good, and if I had time before our party I would have made some adjustments to the wristbands and socks to make them fit better.  However, the foam upper would have driven me nuts after a very short time. Missing Cape",2.0
This is exactly what I was expecting (per one of the other reviewers information). It was exactly what I was looking for and worth the price! Great value for the price!!!,5.0
"I ordered a large due to the reviews I read about this costume. I have to say that the material I despise. The skirt is too big for me and too long. I am 5'9"" 38C wear size large or sometimes xlarge in shirts and in jeans 13-14 and shoe size is 10-11. I am very curvy and thick and I weigh 215 lbs even though I don't look like it since I'm athletic. People might say that I look like I weigh 180; thus, the large fit me loose. The upper body part fit perfect since my breasted filled the cup area, but the skirt is too long and big. The skirt is made from this stretchy metallic material and the whole costume doesn't look like the picture displayed. The headbands and slip on boot covers fit me well. The cape on the other hand is too small and its made from the same material as the skirt. The cape didn't fit my neck properly it will fit someone who's a size smaller. The hand cuffs are way too small and didn't fit halfways. And finally the belt is made from the same metallic stretchy material as the skirt but it doesn't look that great. With the velvet material the upper body part is made of the belt slips up or twists and it doesn't hold in place. Overall probably it will be a good costume for a child but not for an adult. Instead of making me look sexy it made me look sloppy. I was hoping I would look like the girl in the picture since I almost have the same features as wonder woman but its a shame that the skirt makes you look unattractive. Large: It's  a shame but it runs too big",3.0
"One key accessory was missing, the tiara! that is part of the overall look, so that was disappointing, but the rest of the costume was great. Since some of the reviews recommended ordering a size down, I got an XS and it fit perfectly (I was surprised, normally a size 4-6). The skirt wasn't too short, and it was easy to wear and dance in, for those worried about such shenanigans. fun costume!",4.0
"Dress is a velvet top sewn to the shiny skirt. It zips in the back. I got an XS. I am 5' 3"" and 107 lbs, 32A and the top bulged like a bubble in the back and ruffled on the sides. Safety pins weren't enough- the chest was still loose and the sides were still bulgy. The belt was loose too, and attaches by velcro (with no varieties in tightness). The cuffs are loose, but not terrible- a thin, foam material with shiny metal fabric on top that are also difficult to lose their flat shape from shipping. Too bad they weren't just shiny spandex like in the picture.

Cape and boots are not as pictured- cape has a large, unadjustable neck (as oppose to the choker-like one in the picture) and just hangs back from your throat feeling like a loose choke. Boots tops are velvet with an elastic strap meant to go under your arch, and are also kind of loose. The velvet material makes it look Santa- themed. I wouldn't use it with this costume.

All in all, an XS is much too large for a 5'3"", 108 lb person. I wasn't able to tweak it to work. If you have basic sewing skills, then this costume would work. The top is attractive velvety and the skirt is shiny and not too short. It is definitely a more modest costume if that's what you're going for, and if you can get the right size. Order a size down.

I ended up getting Rubie Co's other Wonder Woman costume, ""DC Comics Secret Wishes Wonder Woman Corset Costume"" which worked GREAT

At least I could return it to no cost to me, which was awesome. Too big, too difficult to fix on my own",2.0
"I normally wear a size 8, I got the small as reviews said it ran big. good call.  the boot toppers, as other reviewers called it, are not so great, but hey, it IS a costume.  I plan to buy gogo boots for it later.
with the fact it's a costume in mind, it's great.  as I am short (5'2"") the skirt goes mid-thigh. but I like that.  I'm not uber-conservative, but I'm not an exhibitionist either.
all in all, it's worth it.
don't forget to check Amazon for a lasso. there's one for about $6.  goes great with costume. cute costume",5.0
"Pro's- Pretty sturdy material.  All parts are fabric, so it's comfy to wear.
Con's- dress is huge. I am 5'10"", 175lbs, 36DD and luckily I sew, as I did have to take in the top in order for the dress to stay on.  The boot covers were flimsy and took a lot of double sided tape to cover my own boots and stick on my knees.
Also, I did purchase the WW wig, which looked awesome and was worth the $20. Since I'm keeping the costume I am going to invest in the ""real"" WW boots.
I am a teacher and wore this recently to school.  The skirted dress made it appropriate to wear to school and I did wear a flesh-colored bodysuit on top in case of a wardrobe malfunction.
Everyone was wowed and the children and parents loved it.  After a couple of modifications, this costume looked great.  I will keep it and wear it for a long time. Not a bad product for the price.",4.0

"The package says that items may not be as pictured, and the boots were very different...made out of velour instead of the fabric pictured, and the white stripes on the boots had big red stains on them.  And they don't cover your entire shoes, just the tops..no heel cover.  The reviews I read here said the sizes ran large and to get one size smaller than you usually would, but I am a size 8 and the small was too small, so I should have gone with the medium. The skirt is much fuller than pictured, also. Read the fine print",2.0

"Amazon sent me a XS when I ordered a S and did not have the correct size in stock, so I purchased this exact same outfit from another online Halloween costume site. Luckily that other site was able to get it to me by the morning of my event. This review is just on the costume, based on what I received from the other site...

I'm a size 8 and followed other reviewers' suggestions to order a size down. My chest is on the larger side and this still fit very well. The foamy tiara and cuffs are ok, but I purchased the metal ones and they were MUCH nicer! The boot cover things that come with this costume are a joke. I bought ""Funtasma by Pleaser Women's Halloween GOGO-305,Red/White Stretch Patent"" from Amazon to complete my outfit instead. The gold V belt is not attached, so it moved a lot during the night. I would definitely try to find a way to attach it before wearing this again. Another reviewer also mentioned adding a hook and eye closure at the top of the zipper, which I did because the zipper does not ""lock"" closed at the top.

With all the changes and additions I made, I ended up with a 5 star costume. As purchased, I'm giving this 3 stars. Good Basic Costume",3.0

"I bought this dress for homecoming instead of as a costume. However, it looks great on, for under $30, the quality is very good too. I wear a size xs or like 1 in pants, give or take a size, and the small fit me fine. it has enough room for a ""bigger"" small to be able to wear it(Claims to be for dress sizes 6-8), but it was snug in my hips. It came to about three inches above my knee, and yes, i cut about a layer off to make it more fun.

"While I say it is somewhat large, it is not excessively so.  It is actually more between 'fit as expected' and 'somewhat large'.  I ordered a medium for my daughter (5'8, 130 lb) and it fit her almost perfectly.  A little looser (meaning, not skin tight) and a little longer than expected.  The 'little longer than expected' was a positive as this costume was to be for her to get extra credit at school.  The skirt in the picture shows it a little shorter than I think would have been allowed for regular skirts in school, so the fact it was a little longer than the picture is a good thing!

While it came packaged in a plastic bag, the quality was much better than I expected for the price.  It does not seems as though the fringe will be falling off, which is good.

The dress is slightly low in back, but not excessively so and the front is pretty modest.  The straps of the dress have fringe on them (didn't notice it in the pics).

Overall, very impressed with the quality of this product for the price.  Very good value.

"This was a great costume purchase!  I planned a surprise gangster party for my wife's 45th birthday this year.  I bought this costume without her input, but what a great purchase!  I followed the fit guide provided by California Costumes and bought her a size small.  My wife is petite.  She is 5'3"" tall and weights about 105 pounds.  The costume fit perfectly and she said it was very comfortable.  I had purchased California Costumes in the past, and had knowledge of what a quality costume they make.  This costume was just as pictured in the description and it was a great hit with my wonderful bride.  The costume held up well, and I was able to fold the costume back up and put it in the original packaging again and we will use it for a Halloween event sometime in the future.  California Costumes really does a great job.  We currently have three California Costumes, and I would definitely purchase from them again.  Their fit guides and descriptions are consistent with the actual product, and the quality can't be beat.  I have included a picture of us in our costumes...her is the California Costume, mine is just a deconstructed suit that I made into a gangster costume.  (P.S.  The gray boa, the pearls, the hose, and shoes on my wife's costume were purchased separately, they are not included in the original costume,but they really added some great detail) Another great California C",5.0

If you're curvy around the hips get a larger size. The dress is pretty straight fit. It is a great costume dress overall.  The feather headband was okay.

"So the dress is exactly as pictured and described. And I'm actually really happy with it. HOWEVER. Because of other reviews, I was afraid to order the dress true to size, since so many people have said that the dress runs small.
I am 5""5, 116 lbs, have a small chest and usually wear a small in everything. But I ordered a medium because that's what all the reviews said to do, and the dress is definitely too big. I'm actually fine with it, because it's just a little too baggy and long which actually gives it more of a genuine 1920's look (clothes kind of hung on women back then and were not form fitting).
So, all in all, I would say that if you are looking for this dress to fit you right, and maybe be a little sexier, buy the size you usually wear. If you have some time before the event you're wearing it to, you can always send it back and re-order if it's too big/small.
As far as the product goes, I'm very happy with the quality and everything about the dress. It smells horribly of chemical plastic, so give it some time to air out. And the headdress, as everyone else has mentioned, is sparse and could use some TLC if you're wanting a really snazzy headpeice. But I'm wearing it as is because I think it's just fine.

"Based on other reviews, I expected a snugger fit than what I got. I'm 5'5"" and curvy, typically I wear between a 10 and a 12, so went with the extra large based on what I read about this dress. I could have gone with the large and been a little happier, but overall a great dress at a great price.

"I accidentally ordered this in a x-large which according to the size chart is for a 12-14, i'm usually more of a 14-16 which would have been a XXlarge or plus. I didn't realize this error until after it shipped. I read other reviews which stated this dress ran very small and was short and even recommended to order a size up which made me nervous because according to the measurements on the size chart, this never would fit me with the size i had ordered. I tried it on anyways and I'm glad I did, the X-large fits me perfect and I'm not easy to fit, especially with dresses. I'm 5'7, a 38 DD and more broad across the shoulders with a rectangular torso, like no hip indentations lol but the X-large is dead on, not tight at all, i'm comfortable and have extra room. It hits about 2.5 inches above my knee which i wouldn't consider ""short"" with my arms at my sides my finger tips is about the length of this dress. The only thing I will say is yes it is more fitting around the hip area as this dress is supposed to be like a sheath dress, if you are more hippy or pear shaped, this may not work for you or size up. The head piece that is included is nothing special, elastic with sequins and a feather, kind of scratchy to wear.

Very happy with the purchase.  Fit true to size.  I wear medium size 10 clothes.  My hip and chest are same measurments. I could have gone with a medium or large but decided on large because I wanted a looser fit instread of a snug fit.  Tried  on the dress and it was very nice..Just loose enough to feel comfortable.  As long as your hips  are not disproportionately out of place compared to your chest...the dress will fit true to the size you normally wear.

"I LOVE my costume, it is exactly what I wanted; sexy yet elegant and not 'slutty' looking but fun and out of the ordinary for a perfect Halloween celebration.  I follow the other reviewers and bought a size larger than I normally wear (I am 5'2 and 160 lb) because the reviews stated that it run small and kind of thigh on the hips area, and my size X-Large fits fine, maybe a tad loose on the hips, but then again I am not big on the hips/butt area.  It also might be a bit long for some people (it hits right above my knee, nothing like the model on the picture, but I am 5'2) , but I think that for me it is what I should wear. It could be easily shortened if need and I am still debating if I should just do that. I really like my new costume. Cute Flapper Costume",5.0
"While it seems only ""slutty and bloody"" options are available for any young ladies, this is a perfect alternative, with a little bit of sass, a lot more class, and a whole lot of fun. The dress is awesome, although you may have to wear a black tank underneath, or perhaps shorten it a smidge in the shoulders, in case it fits a tad too low. I expected the headpiece to only be okay, which it was, so I ordered a separate, Gatsby inspired, head piece on amazon . I also ordered strings of pearls on amazon, T-strap shoes, a black and white feather boa, and a cigarette holder. I purchased fish net stockings locally, which I thought might be too much, but it was just the right touch of a detail detail to make the costume ""complete."" Overall, this is a great foundation piece for a flapper costume. I told my daughter it's one to save for costume parties in years to come. Perfect for a young teenager",5.0

The bottom of the dress was really tight (I can see why they said get a larger size than you normally wear). I'm normally am 8 in pants but I do have curves and even the xl was tight around my hips. Over all the dress is made to hide the bad and it worked for the party I was at. At the end of the day I can say I was satisfied. Too big on top, too tight at the bottom!",3.0

"I ordered this costume for a 20s murder mystery party coming up.  It is very cute, just as pictured.  I wanted to write this review because, as others have  mentioned, the costume is small.  I am 5'1"" 105 lbs and normally wear a 0-2, XSP.  I ordered the small and while it fits comfortably (not tight at all), it is not loose on me at all as a regular small normally would be.  Also, it is fairly short considering my height.  I thought this information might help those who are trying to determine what size to buy.  I am very pleased with this purchase. Very cute costume",5.0
I bought this dress for a costume party over the holidays. I had read the reviews prior to buying it and it was mentioned many times that it ran a little small. I usually wear a size large or size 12. I ordered the extra large and it fit perfect. It was not too tight and very comfortable. I got lots of compliments on the dress. The fringe does seem to shed a bit but did not affect the look of the dress. Most of the other flapper dresses at the party had the same problem or the feathers were coming off. Easy to move around in and dance in as well. Arm holes were not too big or too tight which was great. Arrived earlier than the estimated ship date too so that was even better. cute dress and good fit,5.0

It really was the best costume designed for the 1920's that I had seen and I got a lot of compliments on it!

I did read previous comments before purchasing and read that it runs a little small in the hips. I bought one size up from my current size, and it seemed to fit perfectly. Glad I listened to them! Perfect 1920s / great gatsby theme",4.0

"My boyfriend purchased this for me on his prime account, which is why my review isn't an ""Amazon Verified Purchase"". I am 5'2"", 110lbs, 34a, and bought the Small. The dress is fit comfortably at the hips and chest for me but was very loose at the waist. I actually probalby would've prefered an XS if it was an option. The dress probably seems tighter than it actually is because there's no zipper, so you have to wrestle the dress over yourself. Since the dress was cheap,  I ended up getting it altered to have the waist taken in, and it looked great after that.

However, after having it altered and then wearing it once to a party, most of the threads on the dress started to fray and come apart. To me, this was definitely just a one-time use dress. I wouldn't wear it again. Great dress if altered",2.0
"I know other reviewers said that this runs small and to get a size bigger.
I got it just in case it looked good and more the part for the Great Gatsby themed party I went to than my own velveteen long black dress. Glad I had my own dress to wear.  This dress was so tight even my slim, teenage daughter had a hard time fitting into it. And that was the extra-large size.
I bought it thinking that if it was a little too small it would be fine for the children's dressing up box. So will wait till my youngest hits  about age 9 and then she should fit into it! No joke.
However, the Gatsby Rhinestone & Feather Fascinator Cocktail headband was a great hit for the party. I also ordered that through Amazon. way too small",1.0
"Similar to other reviews, costume came quickly; I was hosting a speakeasy holiday party and didn't need to spend a lot of $$, so a costume fit the bill. I expected and got costume quality, which was cheap, but better than spending $200 on a vintage dress I might not wear again! I ordered a large; I normally wear a size 10-12, which can run from medium to large, so I thought I was playing it safe but this dress was so tight in the hips that I could barely get it on. My husband had to help me get into it and because the hips were so tight in the dress, the costume ended up being ridiculously short, so that I had to wear bike shorts underneath to keep it from being obscene! I'm pretty sure flappers were known for loose-fitting clothing, not tight, constrictive clothing. I'm also pretty sure the modern woman could probably not fit into a real 1920s dress, so the size definitely needs to be adjusted. I would not order from California costumes again because of this. Un-flattering flapper dress!",2.0

"I purchased this for a last minute costume (grey scale silent film star). Firstly, I read all the reviews and ordered the small assuming it would fit me b/c the majority of reviews state that it runs small or even extremely small. This is very relative. This is definitely not a junior's small, and arguably a women's small. It was too big on me and frankly, I felt really silly on Halloween but had no time to take it in since I received it that day and had my kid's costuming to contend with as well. Here's my size info in case it helps:

5'5""
103 lbs
32 B

As for the quality, it's pretty good for a bagged costume. You're definitely gonna lose a few strands of the fringe but the slink and drape are good and the under-construction is plenty sturdy for the weight of the fringe. It's not going in your washing machine, but it's a much better look, feel, and quality than the average costume in this price-range. I give it 5 stars, the misunderstanding on size was my fault, not the costume's. Not as Small as I Thought",5.0

"This is a beautiful dress! I was so happy and pleasantly surprised when I opened the package to see this kind of detail. I was amazed of the weight and designer quality. The details in this dress can't be captured by a camera. The tassels are perfectly placed, the satin material is a nice stock and the sequin details are a beautiful touch! Then I tried it on and wow it fit me as if it were tailored for me! It gave me hugged every curve that I didn't know I had and it made me feel so amazing and so sexy! I know my smile must have been from ear to ear at the party that night I got so many compliments, I really felt like a movie star! I will wear this dress to cocktail parties and out to dinner and can't wait to wear it again. I have designer dresses that cost 5 times what this did that don't have the style and quality this does.

I thought it was super cute, but the strings did come off really easily. I didn't lose a large amount that evening I wore it, but I found a few on the ground and just laughed.

"The size large is similar to a ladies 6, and fit my teen daughter very nicely.  She likes the fit (me too) and she's excited for Halloween. I only withheld the 5th star on account of a few fringy pieces already unraveling , which makes them a bit noticeable since they look fluffier than normal.  I easily took care of them with some scissors! Nice looking costume - perfect for what we needed",4.0

The dress itself is exactly what I expected, not the highest quality but perfectly useful. Maybe a little low-cut but that's OK. Would recommend if you're looking for a quick, cheap flapper costume. Runs a full size small",4.0

I knew it was a risk based on the reviews so I also ordered the one made by Forum Novelties in XS/S -- that one fits perfectly.  They both seem identical in look and quality -- the only differences are that this one from CA Costumes is sized too tightly at the bottom, and the neckline of this one is black, whereas the other one is shiny gold.  I actually like the plainness of the black better, but I'll take the gold if it means I'll be more comfortable and confident rockin' a sexy outfit on Halloween! Very cute but sizing is way off",3.0

"This flapper dress is well made for a costume. I bought one for myself and then bought 5 more for the seniors in my dance class for a senior center party. Although we took measurements and checked the measurements against the size chart, I had to return 3 costumes and swap one costume. The dance teacher who usually wears a medium swapped her dress for an x-l. Two women who normally wear large had to exchange their dresses for x-l. One woman who wears an x-l exchanged her dress for a 2x. Only one large dress fit. I would suggest that you order a size or two larger than you normally wear.

I was immediately impressed with the quality of this costume; I had previously tried on similar flapper dresses at the Halloween store in town for twice the price and this one has some weight to it, I can see it lasting many years!

"Costume is super cute, I feel it runs a little small, the medium was practically painted on and was very short, but it still worked for our 20s themed new year's party. runs a little small",4.0
"I am a solid medium in everything I wear, but I had to return the medium and exchange it for a large.  Even the large was tighter on the bottom than I would have preferred.  The bottom portion where the fringe is sewn on doesn't stretch at all, so getting it over your thighs and hips is snug.  It's made of ""costume"" material so don't expect anything fancy, but it certainly does the trick for a costume party for $20.  Just in case you didn't read the description it only comes with the dress and the headband, I ordered a boa and gloves separately (from Hong Kong for cheap) but they still haven't arrived a month later...but that's what I get for being cheap! Definitely order a size up",3.0
"This is a cute and fun dress but like a lot of the other reviews have noted it's sized for a stick person. I wear a 10-12 but opted for the XL after reading the reviews. The XL just barely fits and I'm not sure if I am going to wear it yet. If you have any curves, go a size (maybe even two) up. Cute Dress but Sized VERY small",3.0
"This costume was a life saver because of a) how sexy it was b) how budget conscious it was compared to all those nearly $100 costumed out there now a days c) the good quality. I was really excited to dress up this flapper dress with some fishnets, a boa, cigarette extension, and gloves. For the price it is a really nice costume that got a lot of attention because it looked nice and it's just an easy costume to buy accessories for with very little money. I really liked the touch that the little headpiece added. It is true that the dress fits tight around the legs, I have to admit I deffinitely did a shimmy dance getting into a small but in my case I wanted to go for a sexy flapper look and decided to go with the small not medium. So if you are not trying to do that and want it to fit comfortably i would recommend getting a size larger. I'm going to keep this costume for later use and to lend to friends! Loved it and so did everyone else!",5.0
"It did not fit.  It was much smaller than measurements stated.  I had to return it.  would have liked it if it had fit correctly.  Fabric stretched, but fringe trim did not! sized incorrectly",2.0
"I really liked this costume - Like others I'm glad I read reviews because it was definitely sized small.  I usually wear a small, ordered a medium and it fit great.  The only things keeping it from a 5 star are the sizing issue and also the fringe seems to come off fairly easily.  Not so much that I can't wear it again, but I definitely left a trail... Overall a Success!",4.0
"I got a lot of compliments on my Flapper dress on Halloween. I read the reviews, and ordered one size larger than my normal size. It doesnt come with a headband, or fishnet, ot girdle. I totally reccommend it, great price on Amazon. So cute!",5.0
"Costume was great, I went with other suggestions and ordered a size up. I ordered a Medium and it was snug but fit perfect. I am 5'9'' and wear a size small top and 28 (4 or 6) pants. Headband was a little snug but made the costume! Great but snug",4.0
"Costume looked good when I got it out of the package.
The material is 100% synthetic and a bit see through, and it sheds (the tassels). But I wasn't expecting much from a $20 costume.
I would have kept it but the size is way off. I ordered the x-large, which is supposed to be size 14 - it's not!
I'm a size 14 and I could barely fit into it- let alone wear it. Also since the material is 100% synthetic, it has no elasticity at all, so even if it was my size - it's a hassle to put on/ take off.
I had to return it :( Not true to size",2.0
"This dress is sized very small. I am usually a medium and ordered a medium but it is extremely tight fitting.  Also, cheaply made. I put it on for the first time and about 5 of the fringe fell off. Definitely a one time use sort of dress. Runs small",3.0
Sizes were incredibly inaccurate and the material felt as if it would tear on the first washing. I just expected a little better quality. Too small and cheaply made,1.0

"Runs small, runs tight, is extremely short.  Definitely a halloween costume.  I made it work with black spanx-- otherwise it would have been totally indecent.  Its very flattering because of the fringe placement, so even though i felt like I was wearing lingerie, i got LOTS of compliments. SHORT!!!",2.0

Dress was adorable and the quality was decent for the price. Fit was tight in the thigh area. I'm a size four and the small was snug. Worked fine though. Flapper,5.0
"I bought the for a Roaring Twenties dinner party. I am a size 8-10 and 5' 7""and read the reviews that it ran ""small"". Yes it does. I ordered a large. It fits very snug over the hips, and almost and fine in the bust area. The manufacturer should modify their sizing. I think a xl would have been a better fit in the hips but gape in the bust. But for the price I can make do for one night and maybe a future Halloween party. The quality was better than I expected, although the feather and headband was a little sad. I went and bought a larger feather to add. Good quality for price but Sizing not correct",4.0
"This was shipped super fast, thanks to Amazon Prime. I may never buy a costume in the store again, this was a great buy for the low price. It was almost $60 in the Halloween stores here!

The quality is nice. I got the black. Its not sheer, which I was afraid of, so no slip needed! All of the tassles are attached. I may go buy a new headpiece, this one is a little dinky...but for $20, whatever.

BEWARE OF THE SIZING! I am 5'7"", 135/140 lbs. I ordered a Large after reading reviews and the large fits me almost perfect in the hips because I have larger hips. But the waist, bust and shoulders are a little too loose. I should have ordered a Medium Great for the Price! Watch out for Sizing",4.0
"I ordered a small and had to send it back. I wear a 2/4 and I couldn't get it over my shoulders. I replaced it with a medium, but it is still incredibly tight and has no give in the fabric. Run incredibly small",2.0
"First and foremost, this product runs about 2 sizes small. I wear a ladies 4/6 (usually a size small), and this dress was EXTREMELY tight in a medium. Surprisingly, the top fit fine (I usually struggle up top because my girls are big for my frame). It was very tight through the butt/thighs. Wearable, but at risk of tearing the dress in public, so I slit the dress up the sides and wore a skirt under it, which worked fine for me since I was on a deadline and didn't have time to order a large.

For the price, this costume is actually great. All the seems didn't line up perfectly, and it did shed some of it's fringe, but I don't think I could've done better for the money, and I know it would have cost me more to make something. The costume was a hit at the party, and I could wear it again if I had another reason to. Decent for the money",4.0
"The pricing is right for the quality. The fringe falls out & stretches. The size chart may not be accurate, little too small for me, but I made it work. I would not order it again, but it did serve its purpose & I threw it away after my event. Eh",3.0

DM Hall Great Costume",4.0
"The dress itself is decent, especially for the price. If it had fit I definitely would have been very pleased. Unfortunately the sizing is ridiculously off. I normally wear a 4-6 and ordered the Medium (8-10) since most reviews warned that it runs small. I figured even if it were loose that'd be fine bc that kind of goes with the flapper style anyway. I could barely get it past my chest and the hips were not gonna happen. Honestly, I'm not that curvy so this was a shock. Sadly, I had to return. I wish they had more accurate sizing bc now I'm too hesitant to buy any of the California Costumes items. Sizing needs to be corrected",3.0
"This dress was really comfortable,but definitely good advice on ordering the next size up!!! I wish it had more pictures of it on the site, but the dress itself is very nice. Flapper Dress",4.0
"I like the feel of this dress! Feels like something you can wear on a regular basis- OK not on a REGULAR basis but it feels like an actual piece of clothing as oppose to most of the other costumes, thin, cheap, and wear only once!

I like the headband with feather that it came with. Fits with the costume theme. For the price and quality, it's not so bad. I'd definitely recommend this costume to many friends so we can go as a flock of flapper girls to Halloween parties this year!!

You can dress up the dress with a feather boa and gloves that you'd have to buy separately, which I prefer more over an entire costume that has the gloves and boa... I'd prefer to buy it separately. Most of the time, it's cheaper that way. And you can reuse the gloves with another outfit. Flappin!",4.0
"This dress is perfect!
I bought it as a quick solution for a Halloween costume. I read other peoples reviews and ordered a size up from what I was. So glad I did because it fits perfectly. If I had gone with a medium it wouldn't have been good for my hips. I'm a 8 and I ordered a L and it fits like a glove.
Dresses quality is great for a costume. A good purchase in my opinion, can't wait for Halloween to wear it! Flapp those arms",5.0
"If buying this strictly for an inexpensive costume option, then this dress is worth it.  The sizing runs a bit small (as other reviewers mentioned) so order up a size (or two) if you want to be comfortable.  Also, please note the fringe is a bit fragile so you can expect to lose a string or two in the course of the evening.  Otherwise it was just right for a flapper costume on a budget. Just right for a costume party!",3.0
"I ordered this costume for a '20s party, Chose an XL because I wear a size 12-14 (sometimes larger in the bust) but was pretty disappointed in how flimsy this costume was made and how short and tight it was. It was not too expensive and I would have kept it but it was so short I couldn't even bend over to pick something up let alone sit in it. I returned it and the company was great about crediting my account and accepting the return. too bad, it is a fun costume. Women's Fashion Flapper",3.0
"I bought this so-called costume and i had so many problems with it. Problem number one: the size is all wrong. I am usually in a large, but this time I decided to just make sure it would fit. I could not even get this dress over my torso. I ended up giving it to my size 6 roommate who was able to fit into perfectly, not too big and not too small, but we then ran into the second problem: it sheds! Our room was littered with strings of the dress here and there. It was simply atrocious!!! It was simply horrid!! Horrid",1.0

"I liked the flapper costume. But, be warned it is very tight fitting - I was thankful that I bought a size larger than I usually would. It also is a costume & is not very well made - so strings were falling off of it the entire time I was wearing it. It was a fun costume, but probably only good for this one year. One time only...",4.0
"I was an adorable flapper in this costume! It's not the same quality as if you're buying a fancy dress, but as a costume it withstood a few nights of dancing and still looks good enough to wear next year.
BE AWARE - I am a Medium but that size didn't fit me at all. The dress is sewn very straight on the sides and so it wouldn't fit over my hips and came up too short -way too small. I ordered the Large and it fit perfectly, so order a size bigger than you normally would. Cute Costume; Buy the Size Bigger",4.0
"As some of the other buyers mentioned, it's not made of great material, but it's a typical halloween costume, so it's as expected.

"Quality is kind of what I expected from a costume...only made to wear once. The fringe isn't as full as the picture shows, a lot of the lycra sheath shows through and is see-through.

Also, it fits really small. I wear a medium or a large in most things and I ordered a large to be on the safe side to fit my larger chest...but I can barely shimmy it on over my hips! Not enough time to return so I guess I'll be wearing spanx and sucking in at my costume party. cute, but cheap",2.0

"This costume wasn't bad. I ordered the medium because the provided size chart said that would fit a regular size 8-10 (I'm normally an 8) I got the costume about 4 days after ordering and when I tried it on, it was VERY tight and I was almost afraid to wear it out! But it seems to stretch some after being worn and was very cute and everyone loved it! Not bad for the $",4.0

"This is the SOFTEST plush robe!! I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it.

"This bathrobe is exactly what I wanted in terms of fit and comfort.  On cold nights in the Pacific Northwest, this robe is oh so warm and goes all the way to my ankles.  The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the dye job.  The color does not look like the burgundy in the picture at all, but rather like some faded pastel version of it.

"This robe is everything I hoped it would be!  Just got it, and I love it!!  It's soft and warm and cuddly, and yet it's not heavy feeling to me.  I don't think this is a robe to wear when you get out of the shower.  This is a snuggly, watch TV, sit-by-the-fire kind of robe.

I ordered the Large in the Almond color.  I'm 5'6"", with short legs, and about 130 lbs. with average measurements for that height/weight.  I like plenty of wrap-around in a robe, so the size large is perfect for me, but some people would think it's too big.  A medium actually would probably fit me ""normally"" without so much wrap-around.

When I have it cinched around my waist, the length is about 2 inches above my ankles.  The sleeve length is great for me, but I guess some people would think they are a little long, since I got the Large.  They go over the top part of my hand, and I have normal-length arms.  They could be rolled up, too, if you wanted.

I really like the almond color.  It's like a stuffed teddy bear.

It is very very warm, the fabric is thick and plush.  It is not the soft fluffy fleece or microfiber you will find in the malls.  If you get warm very easily or live in warm climates, this will be too heavy.  If you want to feel like you are snuggling in a cloud and staying toasty warm, then this is perfect.

The armholes are generous, the sleeves long enough to turn up should I want to  do some chores.  The lapels are nice and wide and the inner tie actually is long enough to tie and of the  same material as the robe, so no cold satin against the skin.

Hey, you can always wear the pretty pj's under the robe and still be roasty toasty. Seriously, buy this robe for yourself, and one for everyone you know for the holidays. Love it!

"This is the robe I've been looking for.  I had ordered a verrrry thick (and equally long) terry robe a few weeks earlier and just found the extreme weight of it to be offputting every time I reached for it.  I thought - I do need the warmest robe (and full ankle length) I can find, but does it really have to be SO heavy?  Then I went searching and found THIS robe - got it today and it envelopes my body wonderfully just like the terry robe, but it's LIGHT.  Thick, plush and light.  I am every bit as warm, but far more comfortable, and it has a really good quality fluffy texture -- doesn't look cheap or tacky as some micro fiber or synthetic robes I've seen which have more of the look of fake fur or a skimpy uneven pile or a ""trailer trash"" look; grungy, old and lived in from day one.  No, this robe looks luxurious and evokes a spa, and somehow as thick as it is, it even manages not to make you look enormous, that part was a surprise.

The only thing I would wish if for another 2-3 inches in length.  I am 5'9"", 140 pounds, and ordered the large. I really couldn't go with X or XX Large just for more length - the bottom of the robe comes to 7 inches from the ground (or 3 inches from my ankles) - pretty much like the photo of the man - it doesn't come as far down as the one the woman is wearing (clearly she's shorter).  I get that robe makers can't please everyone and I'm somewhat tall for a woman so they can't make robes long enough for me that would drag the floor for other women. But I wish it was longer anyway.  I do feel the draft on the few inches of my exposed ankles.  And no I don't want to bend my aching back in the morning to struggle with pulling on socks in the morning before I have my coffee.  The whole point of a robe and slippers is you just stumble groggily and slip easily into them and done - an all-in-one solution.  Oh well, otherwise this robe is as good as it gets - I combed the entire internet comparing them all. Warm, flattering, soft, and light!",5.0

"I ordered this robe based on reviewers saying it was really warm. Looks like it will be - in which case I will forgive the two disappointments. First, there is the swimmingly large fit in the size small. I did not catch on to the unisex sizing until too late. Second, a problem occurred with the first wash. Because the robe arrived with a faint chemical smell I immediately washed it, separately, so the color would not run. My high efficiency front loading washing machine could not perform its spin cycle due to the weight of the water in the fabric and the unbalanced load. So the whole sopping wet mess had to be wrung out repeatedly over the next two days and finally air dried for a few hours in the dryer and overnight outside. Fortunately I live in a dry climate. All will be forgiven if it keeps out the cold...",3.0
"Very generously sized.  I bought the small at 5'-5"" and 150# and there's plenty of room!!  In retrospect I would have ordered the XS but I don't mind the extra wrap-around room.  The robe is very soft, very warm, and has a lovely large collar. Very soft & warm",5.0

"This robe is a blast.  Bought it as a gift for the wife, but when she's at work, this stay at home dad pampers himself in luxury with this robe.  Neither the wife nor I are petite folks, and this robe swims on her, envelopes her completely.  It fits me like one would expect a robe to.  The thick plush is ultra warm, and amazingly soft, but be warned, when laundering, be generous with the fabric softener or it will lose a little of that super snuggly muppet vagina feel.  It is truly awesome to cuddle into this robe on a cold winter's day, especially if pairing that with an at home foot bath or some aromatherapy candles. So comfortable, it's like snuggling into a muppet's vagina",5.0

"I was looking for a robe that fit the full length of my body from neck to ankles, and this fulfilled that. I'm 5'3"", I ordered the small, and the length is perfect. In addition, it is warm and soft and lightweight as described.

However, nearly everything else didn't work for me:

1) I ordered the red color and it looked faded, not nearly as rich and lush as the red shown in the picture, it was more like rust. Not a big deal if color doesn't matter for you. It just bothered me that I paid 85 dollars for this and it looks ratty out of the box. I would advise getting a lighter color like the lavender.

2) Next, while the length was exactly what I was looking for, the width of this robe is extremely wide. I wear a women's size 4 pants and this robe has just too much fabric to fit comfortably. It is bulky on me. What's weird is that the arms were an exact fit, so if I went down a size to X-Small, I think the arms would be too short.

All this to say, it would have been worth the money for me if the fit was more precise. If that were the case, I'd just send it back with a color change. Needless to say, it's being returned for full refund. My search for a full length robe continues. Very Odd Fit",2.0

"I am very pleased with the robe's warmth, soft touch and weight and fit, but I would love to be given the option of a tall size for robes.  I do understand the difficulty this represents to companies, but maybe there could be an un-hemmed version that we could take to the tailors.  If un-hemmed robes were available, we would have the ability to make it the garment full length and keep our ankles warm.  Cold feet are one of the main problems for many people, and a full length robe is a much more elegant look than one that is cropped at the ankles.  Of course, if it came un-hemmed, one could also crop it at the ankles if that is the desired length.

I expect this robe will wash and dry like a dream, too, although I haven't tested it yet since it is a gift.  The only other suggestion I would make is that I would love to have options of having an option of maybe a few very feminine robes with gorgeous A lines with flattering colors (like this cranberry color) suitable for new mothers and Valentine's Day and Mother's Day and Christmas, etc., to remind women of their feminine beauty without sacrificing cozy!...with matching slippers!!!

My real USGI belt was much thicker and the buckle is brass painted black. This belt buckle is stamped steel painted black and says made in Taiwan on the back where my real one says 'US' and has a manufacturer's stamp of some sort. I'm using my original buckle, it looks better since the paint wore off and now the brass is exposed and it's higher quality. Tossed the stamped steel one that came attached to the belt in the garbage. Not quite the real deal",2.0
"Briefly, I had a childhood accident 30+ years ago that caused arthritis in my foot.  Not bad, but a constant, nagging pain sensation that I learned to just live with.  Finally, I saw a podiatrist who referred me to a pedorthist to be fitted with footwear that could alleviate my pain.  I wound up with a pair of Birkenstock sandals and I've never turned back.

They're great.  No more foot pain, period.  I wear dress socks and the sandals to work everyday (in an office environment -- I got flack for that from co-workers, but the needling didn't bother me and management never took me to task, either), to church, everywhere.  I've a different pair of Birkies for the beach and lawn work -- not as comfortable as the suede uppers on these Arizona's.  The mocha suede straps have held up wonderfully despite getting wet and lightly soiled from time to time.

Admittedly, it's a lot of money to spend, but the shoe store my pedorthist works in re-soles the Birkies for about $30, and will replace the cork and sole both for about $50.  The re-soled sandals last about a year, but remember, I wear them daily and I often walk a few miles each day.

In short, these sandals have dramatically improved the quality of my life and foot arthritis is no longer any concern for me.  Not bad for a little more than $100. It's all I wear",5.0

"I couldn't fathom spending $30 on a silicone jacket for my new baby, so this one does the job. The screen protector does bubble, so I don't use it, and I'm not much of a jogger, so I pitched the armband too. But I found the covering over the click wheel actually helps cut down the sensitivity (I was having a lot of trouble mis-selecting songs because I kept brushing it with my giant thumb while trying to hit the play button). It fits perfectly, came in a good color, and it don't cost more than the clothes on my back, so I can't complain. you get what you pay for",3.0
"When I bought this item, the idea was to use it when I workout or go running.  What I found when I recieved it was that it was really really cheap.  The silicon is thin.  That wouldnt be so bad if the plastic belt clip and the armband did not use that as the means of holding on the the IPod.  The thing feels like if I were to jump hard enough the IPod would fall out or would tear the silicon.

In my opinon, if you are planning on getting this case as a means for holding your IPod while working out or for the use of the belt clip do not get it. This thing is too cheap to hold on to your 250 - 350 dollar ipod. But if you are looking for a cheap functional case for your IPod so that it does not get scratched, go ahead and get it. Cheap....",2.0
"This case keeps your iPod the way it's meant to be, THIN.  I have the pink case which looks great with my white iPod.  And it fits perfectly.

It is a little more costly with the shipping, but you get the armband, etc. etc.  Haven't used any of the accesories yet.

TIP:  If you're putting this case on a brand new iPod, peel up the original plastic protecting the front of the iPod and cut just below the screen.  This way, your screen will still be protected in the original packaging and you can save the screen protector they send for a replacement.

I do wish it covered more of the silver part near the USB and the armband holes in the back, but hey, obviously I understand you need to be able to plug it in and get the armband through. The hold switch and headphone cutouts are perfect. Great looking functional case",4.0

"Well i really like the material, bacause it's soft and the click wheel feels great when you scroll. i haven't tried the armband yet because i'm scared my ipod will fall out. it's on the cheap side.

"I'm not a runner and I don't jog however, I do bike and use various exercise equipment.  For my purpose this is great.  My iPod is protected, love the light weight of the case, the armband has a very wide and long velcro closure and adjusts well to lower and upper arm areas.  The color of case does make the viewing screen area the same color of case but while I'm excersing I'm not looking at my display every 5 minutes, this is meant to be a convenience tool.  Excellent price too. Suited up and ready to workout",5.0
"The case itself protects the iPod very well, however if you try to use the armband for running - forget it. The material is too flimsy to give good support. My iPod bounced around on my arm so much that it froze in the middle of my run! Don't buy if you're a runner",2.0

"The watch winder works exactly as described. I think this is a good value product. Especially when compared to the multi hundreds dollar watch winders on the market. It does look a little bit plastic. But the winder is well built and is reasonably quit when turning.

It comes with 4 different timer settings and 3

different turning direction settings: left, right and alternating.

I calculated the number of rotations per day based some measurements.

Setting:

  A:  rotate 33 seconds, rest 12 minutes:  300  rotations/day

  B:  rotate 10 minutes, rest 90 minutes:  660  rotations/day

  C:  rotate 30 minutes, rest 3 hours  :  940  rotations/day

  D:  rotate 1 hour, rest 3 hours  :  1700 rotations/day

I use setting B for my watch with ETA 2824 movement. Every watch has a specific requirement as of how many rotations per day it needs to remain fully wound. See you watch specifications.

The winder does not come with the possibillity to run on batteries, that is a pity I think.

As I just bought it I can not say anyting about long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps on running I think this i a very good buy.

So far I am very pleased with it! Garinin watch winder with MULTI SETTING TIMER",4.0

"After reading some of the negative reviews, I was really hoping that these potentially lethal (and euphemistically named) ""boot shapers"" would turn out to be at least as dangerous as described. I relished having one (or two, or all six) of these spring-loaded fashion bombs explode in my face, taking out an eye and allowing me to finally wear an eyepatch like my hero,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snake-Plissken/dp/B003O7I6L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snake Plissken</a>, without ridicule. I dreamed of making small talk with a beautiful ER nurse as she picked white plastic shrapnel from my face. I got a Chris Matthews-sized tingle up my leg as I anticipated the angry red welts that the metal bands would give me as they smacked my tender flesh.

Alas, even after inserting and removing these shapers numerous times in three separate pairs of engineer boots, I have been unable to get them to do anything but effectively and elegantly hold my boots' uppers in an upright position.

For my next pair of boots, I'm going to buy a pair of steel-jawed coyote traps. Or better yet, a family of live cobras. Disappointed that they work so well",5.0
"Very needed product for not only maintaining shape of boots, but easy storage in closets, rather than piled on top of each other! Boot Shapers",5.0
"I ordered two pairs of these boot shapers and within one month, one pair broke! (The metal piece that holds the two plastic sides together snapped out, and it won't go back in.)

This is just what I was looking for. They work great. I was surprised to find they also hang. I love them and will order more!!! Fantastic,5.0
"I purchased these boot shapers because the price seemed very good. As I should have predicted, you really do get what you pay for. The shapers are two pieces of pink plastic connected by two strips of metal. The strip of metal are curved and attached (in the most ineffective way you could ever imagine)to each piece of plastic. You are supposed to squeeze together to place into your boot and then release to maintain the shape of the boot. All of this is wonderful in theory, but the poor construction precludes easy use of the shaper without constantly having to reinsert the metal strips into the tiny little clips cut out for them in the plastic. This is a waste of time and, as some other users have noted, quite dangerous. I think you could seriously injure yourself with these if you got a flying strip of metal in the face as you're trying to put it into your boot. I put them into my boots facing away from me, but the metal strip still flies out and scares me 1 out of every 2 times I use it. Next time I will invest in something better constructed and less dangerous. To be clear, this is a problem with the product, not with the seller, who sent the package promptly and had everything nicely packaged for shipment. very poor quality and quite dangerous - do not buy",1.0

"I purchased some awesome boots made with a really soft Italian leather that I didn't want to crease by just letting them flop in my closet.  I researched all the options for inexpensive, yet effective boot trees and chose Boot Shapers. PERFECT!!!  Easy to use if you compress them in the right spot and they hold my boots in perfect shape. Exactly what I wanted",5.0
"This is a great invention!  Contrary to the other comment these are easy to operate if you have a little common sense... the spring-like action is in the center of the shaft of the boot shaper; therefore you should squeeze the whole thing together at that point while putting it in the boot... duh.
You just pop them in and your boots stand right up like they were on a mannequin... a great idea if you ask me.  They come with a hanger attached to the top loop of each boot shaper that stays hanging down but if you wanted to hang your boots up in your closet the hanger would come in very handy for that.
You really cannot beat the price either.  I hate it is not PRIME shipping available as I am a prime member but I have done business with shoebuy for years under Amazon and outside of Amazon and they are great.  Very fast and friendly.

"These are horrible.  I tried putting the first one into a a boot three times and the metal strips popped out three times.

So I purchased the weatherproof ""wax"" and leather ""honey"" to help with leather maintenance.

"I have six sets  of these bought a year ago, and 3 I just received right now.  The old ones are the menace described in many other reviews.  The metal bands that were supposed to stay clipped into each of the plastic sides (which provides the pressure to make them actually shape the boots) did not stay clipped - they spring out on 3 of the 6 OLD pairs.  But, the new ones have a much better system - the metal bands have a very solid latch onto the plastic sides.  Very, very pleased with the new design. new design - much improved",5.0
I have really enjoyed my boot shapers. The ones that I got were pink. The shaper part is a hard plastic material. Only thing is be careful inserting the shapers since it has a metal piece and I have read that sometimes it can snap back at you. Mine have not done that yet. Boot Shapers,5.0
These boot shapers work great and are not difficult to use - just slip them into your boots and the boots stand by themselves. They can be hung from a closet bar but even when the boots are standing on the floor the boot shapers hold the boots upright keeping them clean and shapely. Just what your boots want!,5.0
"Okay I just got these and slipped them right into my boots and they are keeping the shape.  I don't think this was hard at all to figure out.  I love them, plus they are a great value! I'm definitely going to buy another pack of three. They even come with a little hanger if you have hanging space in a huge closet (I don't have that luxury right now).  Great product, great value, easy breezy! So simple, what's the fuss?",5.0

"I was searching for boot shapers just so my closet wasn't piled high with boots that always flopped over, taking up more space than what I was ok with giving up.
These are so simple, and so effective they are a no brainer. I bought several packages .. and now all of my boots are standing tall and in a tidy row. Best of all the price is right! amazing!",5.0
"I received these yesterday and immediately put them in my boots.  They work perfectly.  A little trouble getting them in because you have to squeeze to put them in.  But for the boots with zippers, I unzipped them, put the trees all the way down and then held the boot together and zipped - PERFECT.  Now my leather boots won't get creased!! Perfect Solution",5.0

"Recently, I purchased one pair of Boot Shapers at a big bed and bath store and loved them; but at $10 a pop, I knew this could get pricey buying 10+ pairs (and I didn't want to buy them one at a time with the 20% off store coupon).  I had been using rolled up newspapers, after awhile they get broken down and need to be replaced. I really love these.  They are simple to use and look great in white. Not only do they keep all heights of boots (from booties to thigh highs) up straight, the way they are made, allows for air to circulate all the way down to the toe area.  Without these, the boots fold over and there is no way for air to get down inside and freshen them up, definitely beats my primitive newspaper option.  Also, there is the cleaver alternative to hang them with the attached hook. Love this company, my package was received before the seller's earliest anticipated delivery date. These Boot Shapers are awesome, you'll regret it later if you don't buy more than the one pack of three. Great product, Great price",5.0

I simply squeeze them when I put them into my boots, and then pull the hanger to get them out.  They have been very simple for me to use.

Thanks I love these",5.0

My sister asked for these for a stocking stuffer for Christmas... so I bought them for everyone including myself.  The only comment I have is.... why didn't I get these sooner?  My closet looks great and it makes conditioning tall boots (including riding boots) MUCH easier! Great product.,5.0
I read the reviews on this and don't have ANY of the problems noted.  They are simple to put into a boot and then hold them up perfectly.  If you try to fuss with them too much I guess they could cause problems....but I haven't had an issues myself. So good I ordered another pair,5.0
"I bought these to use with the boot rack and it works great. The only problem I have is that the hanger faces the wrong way, and if you turn the boot shaper so it faces the correct way, the boots are not shaped correctly. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, it still works great on the boot rack since the hanger is a flexible plastic. I worry that the plastic may eventually break since I have to twist it to the correct direction to hang it on the boot rack. I also bought the boot bags (from Bootique) but 2 of the 6 bags had broken zippers and it was a struggle getting my boots into the bags so I would not recommend buying the boot bags.

"I purchased 6 pairs for the wife who has too many boots, shoes, clothes, etc...  They are made of plastic and the inner tension rod is made of metal.  The rod has enough resistance that the boot is sturdily held upright perfectly.  To place inside the boot you simply squeeze the shapers while pushing them down into the boot.  They may be a little difficult to insert at first but with a little practice it becomes easier.  A hook is also included which allows the boots to be hung from a closet rod; very nice indeed.  The wife loves them so I can't complain. Work well",5.0
"The presentation of this shirt on the website led me to believe that it had french cuffs. It did not.  However since I needed it within a particular time period I had to use it.

I removed them because they made a slight bulge in the shirtfront with the studs installed. It met the need",3.0
"This is a very nice looking shirt for the price.  It arrived quickly.  And even though the sizes are not exact - depending on your neck size they will select S,M,L,XL along with the correct sleeve length - it still was a decent fit. NIce shirt for the money!",5.0
"After passing over many cheap tux shirts that were offered in size S/M/L/XL/2XL available on the internet, I chose to take a chance on this one, because the web page offered actual size selections based on neck size and sleeve length.  I need a 16-1/2 35 shirt, which falls somewhere between L and XL.  L is too small and XL is too big.  I was very disappointed when they sent me this shirt in size L.  I contacted the seller and they explained that this shirt is not available by neck size like they advertised.  They look at the size you order, and send you the size they think is the best approximation of what you ordered.  Had I known this up front, I never would have placed the order.  I returned the shirt and received a full refund, but I got stuck for the return shipping.  I think the size selection on the web page is very misleading. Size selection misleading",3.0
I was surprised at the quality of the shirt. I halfway expected to get something with scratchy material that looked as cheap as the shirt was. The shirt is comparable to those I have seen in other stores for 2 or 3 times as much...Good buy. I will use them again. Impressed,4.0

"The pleats are crisp, the shirt is comfortable, and it looked fantastic under my tuxedo jacket. It comes with plastic studs to look good in the package. Remove them to use your own, or use the buttons like a regular shirt. The cuffs require cufflinks. The collar button is on a short elastic so it has a small amount of stretch to it.

I just returned from a 15 day cruise and there were 3 formal nights. On the first night, the shirt fit fine. Half way through the cruise on the second formal night, the shirt collar was feeling tight. On the 14th night, and final formal night, I left the collar button undone and used my bowtie to keep the collar closed. Did you know that shirts didn't originally have collar buttons and ties were used to hold the shirt closed on the top? I paid homage to history to compensate for the shrinking collar (which might have had something to do with all the extra eating I did). Crisp and comfortable",5.0

The shirting material was thinner, so the pleated front was very, very pronounced comparatively. We were not fans personally, but in fairness the issue would probably be minimized with a white undershirt.

Construction was nice and crisp, the pleats were sized well and uniform however, so I would still recommend for those looking in this price range. Solid choice for price range",4.0

The shirt looks nice and fabric is fine.  What I found to be a problem is that it lead me to believe that I could chose specific neck size and that is not the case.

"I wore this shirt casually (without a tie and top button open) and this shirt fit me well. I have an athletic build so it was a little loose on the waist and stomach area, but that's to be expected from a shirt that isn't a slim fit design.

The collar button extends a bit and when I tried it, I was still able to close the shirt comfortably.

The pleated front and collar are perfect, as in the picture. As some people reported, the body of the shirt that is invisible under the jacket is somewhat light/see-thru but the fabric is strong. I wore a white teeshirt under the shirt which allowed me to take off my jacket when things got late and informal and I looked perfectly acceptable.

"I was a little skeptical at first purchasing formal wear online without being able to try it on or touch it.  I can say that my skepticism went right out the window as soon as I received this shirt. High quality fabric, the fit is perfect, the neckline was my main concern, but it fits as though it was tailored just for me.  I have already told a few friends about it.  Really love this shirt and the price isn't bad either. Quality of the shirt really surprised me.",5.0
"My husband has to go to many black tie optional and black tie events for work throughout the year.  We finally sprung for a tux and I was looking for a formal shirt that was nice, yet not crazy expensive.  This one fit the bill.  I was not expecting much due to some of the reviews but the most recent reviews looked positive so I ordered. On Amazon, I always go by the most recent reviews because that carries more weight to me than one from 2009 or so.  My husband  is  5'8, 42 inch waist and wears a 20 neck 34/35 sleeve, so I chose the 20 34/35 on Amazon as the option.  When took it out of the package, this shirts tag just says ""4X' on the inside (but their sticker on the onside of the package said 20, 34/35). He tried it on and everything was perfect but the neck was a little large (before adding a tie). Just a little bigger than he liked, leaving a little gap.  However, sleeves, belly area, everything fit PERFECT besides the neck being a little too large.  So, I washed the shirt in hot water and put it in the dryer and the neck is now absolutely perfect. Fits him 100% now.  The shirt looks great and fits like a dream.  The quality is great for the price.  Also, I took the advice of another review and bought these&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cufflinks-and-Studs-Set-for-Tuxedo-Formal-Black-with-Shiny-Silver-Trimming-by-Men-s-Collections/dp/B004NKD3J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cufflinks and Studs Set for Tuxedo - Formal Black with Shiny Silver Trimming by Men's Collections</a>&nbsp;button studs and cufflinks.  The button studs that come with the shirt are very cheap plastic and on the small side (as you'd expect for free) and you could get away with them for a one time event like a wedding or formal event, but if you will wear the shirt over and over I'd go for nicer studs. Also, I had no quality control issues.  All the stitching is just fine -- the shirt was not thin as one review said. We are very pleased. This was a FAR better buy then going to big and tall shops here all over town looking for a tux shirt that would #1 would fit and #2, still spending $75 or $100 on it locally. Great shirt, neck a little large but one hot wash and dry took care of that.  Highly recommend this shirt!",5.0

The quality of the shirt is rather good but the sizing is way off.

I like a more slim fit so I did not like the fit of it.  The shirt studs are cheap plastic so I would recommend buying some nice studs for the shirt if you want to use them. I ended up returned the shirt because one of the regular shirt buttons (not stud) was broken in half. No problems with the return. Not my type of fit,2.0
"Bought a few non-Neil Allyn shirts before...MISTAKE! Stick with the best! As inexpensive - yeah, under $50 is inexpensive for a tux shirt - tux shirts go, Neil Allyn is the standard.

I'm pushing a 48/50 chest at this point, so... the XL is not quite there. 35 fits my just under 35 arms perfectly. There's good room - it's NOT a trim fit..it's comfortable. The shirt lays well and looks great. Button holes are slightly under-cut, so you may have to press to put studs in, but otherwise, it's made well and holds up to the workouts. Perfect fit...finally got my size right!",5.0

"After getting proper measurements, I spent hours shopping and trying on various shirts that were available in nearby stores. When that came up short, I went to Amazon and other online stores and began my research based on availability, quality, reviews, and value for money. I was confident when I ordered this shirt. However, when it arrived, the neck size was perfect but the arm length was off and the body of this shirt was HUGE! As another reviewer stated, ""I was swimming in it."" I did not expect it to be tailored but I expected better quality than what was received. I should have given more attention to the one review that said ""they look at the size you order and send you the best approximation of what you ordered."" I have since purchased a better quality shirt at another store I found. I had to spend a bit more money but bottom line is you get what you pay for. I can't work with generic sizing. Shirts like these need to be exact. This shirt is going back. NOT what was expected!",2.0

"Great quality slacks, I love the fit, length, sturdiness, etc.  Too bad Carhartt changed the front leg velcro-ed pockets.  They used to be full cut velcro across the top -- easily to slip my mobile or a pad into.  Now the pocket is a weird slanted-3/4-cut velcro, and it's trickier to slip my mobile, etc into.  Maybe more resistant to being nicked, but I preferred the older style.  Still a terrific slack, and my favorite. Love the Fit; Don't like the new pockets",4.0

"As with most Carhartt men's clothing, you have to be careful on sizing and these pants are no different. If you normally wear a 32, you will have to go with a 33. 32 will be too small, and 34 too big! Other than that, Great pair of work pants. Typical Carhartt quality work pants!",5.0

"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length. Order 2"" longer than you need",5.0

Very nice men's work pants and so much cheaper to purchase here on Amazon then at the local Tacoma work wear Store but I highly recommend if you wear a size 40 then get 1 size bigger because even though it's a really nice pair of pants it runs small and unfortunately I'm having to send back mine and having a place a reorder of the correct size so it's unfortunate because it's a inconvenience but as we all know it's simple to letting Amazon know the status and issues and getting a refund and then having to Place another order for the exact same pants just a size bigger.

Only gripe I have is that they do run a little larger, used my Levi 501 size and these feel really baggy and I have to roll the legs up a bit. But it's not a major detriment to the pants.

"These were for my son who wears a 32x34 He said these were tight in the waist, and is hoping that these will loosen up with wear. The material is heavy duty, but light for summertime in Florida comfort. Also these pants look dressier than jeans, the color is much fuller than the pix show, real deep color. Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit.

Nothing even comes close to them.  He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these...it really made my day! :) Everything about them...he loves but the pockets are the real deal for him!  He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.  If anyone knows where I can get the Carhartt Men's Canvas Utility Shorts....please let me know!! I've searched the whole internet and still have not been able to locate any of them anywhere :(!! My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!  Thanks for 2 great items and hopefully those shorts will be made available to purchase again very soon so that I can be happy and my boss can be too! :)  Thanks and have a great day! :) By the way....We both give this product a 5 STAR!!!! ***** He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these.",5.0

"The pants are unbelievably durable, yet lightweight and somewhat stylish. Great for different uses and different climates. The side pockets on carpenter pants are very useful, without the pockets sticking out like cargo pants.

I'm docking one star because the sizes are all wrong. I have size 36 waist pants from other brands, that are a looser fit than the 2 pairs of size 40 Carhartt pants I bought. Size 40 fits fine, but Carhartt's ""36"" would have been impossible for me to wear. The company should really look into correcting their measurements. Just a head's up. Buy two sizes up",4.0

"Great fit in the leg (I have large legs) and as others said the waist is a bit tight so I ordered the next size up, I normally wear a 34x32 in Carhartt denim pants, so I got these in 35x32. These are noticeably tighter in the waist and I probably should have gotten a 36. The inseam was a bit long too; these are at least 1-2 inches longer when compared to the denim. Also, the seat feels a bit cramped when sitting.

Size aside, these are noticeably cooler (temperature) than denim. The leg pocket is a perfect fit for an iphone 6 without a case. They feel really well build, however the sizing is greatly different from Carhartt's denim sizing. I'm not certain I'll be ordering these again. poor sizing, but very breathable pants.",3.0

"Comfortable, durable, well constructed.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Disappointing. I'm not going to through the pants out but I can not wear them for work. Good pants. But I wish the phone pocket were bigger and more secure...",3.0

These are comfortable pants. They are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how long they will last if you are doing outdoor work or looking for a pant that will be rugged. I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue. I suggest if buying to be prepared to way over size the waist size by at least 3-4 inches.

I have been looking for pants that will work for my husband at work. We searched many many hours both online and off. When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more. This is a regular family purchase for our family. Light weight and perfect for hot jobs,4.0

"I didn't realize how loose ""loose"" meant. Waist and hips fit good but the legs don't taper even a little. They feel too roomy, like having your legs in paper bags.

If you can confirm these haven't been dyed in anything containing formaldehyde or any other known toxins I'd give them a 5. Not too shabby.",4.0

I like the subtle design of the cargo pockets that are a bit more to the rear of the leg and less obvious as other cargo pocket pant designs which gives the pants a sleeker and dressier look.

Hubby does alot of work on his knees, so after several months, the knees do wear out and rip, so it's patch time and they last and last and last.  They offer great protection when hiking through brush or working in the woodshop or with tools.  I highly recommend this brand.

Sadly my old canvas pants are seeing the end of their days, and now I think Carhartt has too, for me anyway. Low quality & higher prices have ruined an age-old name. Immediately returned them for a refund...

The pockets are deep enough to fit my hands up to the wrists and the back pockets fit my wallet well.

I have gotten all kinds of crap on them and they seem to wash well.  Dried joint compound came right off with my fingernail and the residue washed right out.  They don't wrinkle too bad and I haven't had any shrinkage from the wash yet.  The bottoms fit right over all the boots and shoes that I've worn with them without any bunching at the hems, but the cuffs aren't so big that they drag on the ground behind the shoe either.

"Seems like people tend to think these pants run smallish ... they seemed fairly normal to me.  And the Amazon return policy is so easy, if you do need to exchange them, it's no problem.  The waist is a little higher than I expected; nothing too dramatic, just a little different.  Nice casual pants. Pretty much hits the mark!",4.0

"I really like these pants.  My only issue: in the past carhartt pants have had issues shrinking lengthwise, I usually ordered a 36"" inseam and expected them to shrink down to 34"".  I did that with these pants and they did not shrink at all in the inseam so they are a bit long.  Other than that these are great pants.  Comfortable and durable. These don't shrink!",4.0

"Bought these pants for work. I wear a 33x32 for most everything. These pants are way big in the legs, the waist is too big and they're too long. I thought they would shrink up a bit but they didn't. If I had to buy these again I'd go with a smaller size because these ended up being too baggy on me. They've been in fairly consistent use and are now starting to wear out after about a year. Overall, they're good pants but I would definitely order the next size down. Others have said they run big or run small so go try them on in a store before purchasing. Carhartt stuff seems to have a lot variation in it's sizing. they're good pants but too big",3.0

"I bought two pairs of these because I know my exact size which is usually enough to buy without needing to try the pants on.

The first pair I got, Mushroom, were much longer than the listed inseam, I'm stepping on them every step, so either I return or pay for the them to be tailored.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?  It costs me a lot to have these tailored and they aren't worth it but I need pants and I already lost enough time on this. The length is very inaccurate, way off!!!",2.0

"The rise of these pants is incredibly high. Walking was uncomfortable because I couldn't take full steps which made me look like I'd just messed myself. Additionally I need to be able to straddle roof ridges for wok and without hiking these up over my belly button there was no way to accomplish that.

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut. Different material but basically cut like mom jeans. Feels like Mom Jeans",3.0
They are OK. Kinda flimsy construction. I've had them for about 6 months and they are already pretty worn. The right thigh pocket re-inforcement gets all bunched up and annoys the crap out of me. I do like the way they fit and the overall design. These are not even close to a pair or arborwear pants or a pair of heavier duty Carhartts though. Meh,2.0

"Just like the others say, it runs small in the waist. I saw this and ordered larger than I normally wear. It still fits too snug for my liking and I need to go up two inches in the waist for comfort - which is going to be almost 3-4 inches above what I wear in other clothes. Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.
Now the pants look and feel great, nice and light, good length, they are sort of baggy in my opinion but not much at all, just loose fitting. So I will try again with a larger size or try the regular fit. Too small in the waist and zipper areas",4.0

"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead. (A little side note to the big men. I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well) Paging Mr. Big Thighs......We have your pants!",5.0

I've purchased these before fit good comfortable and they have high back. Sick of low cut any thing. As a builder you put things in the pockets and pulling your pants up every two seconds gets old. These stay up. Great fit and comfortable.,5.0
"Should have bought these before I ever started landscaping. Best pants on Earth. Hold up to anything. Fit incredibly comfortable - no restriction of movement like jeans. I've got muscular legs that normally don't comfortable fit jeans, but these are great without being baggy.

You can wear them for days at work before having to switch to the next pair. I have 3 pairs now and never run out doing laundry once a week. Just hang them up after a day of work and put them right back on the next day with a little dirt on them, but these colors make it hard to see. Once they're noticeably dirty or get wet, I wear the next ones.

The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this. I believe there are fabric treatments that can greatly help this and are not too costly. Great fit but terrible tendency to wrinkle",3.0

We need a little room.
Well guys, look no further, I have found the quintessential work pants for the real men that are left with their parts intact.

"I've bought a few pairs of canvas pants from other brands and have been really happy with them.  So I figured that spending the extra money on a pair of Carhart's might be worth the extra money, I was very disappointed in the quality of the fabric, very thin and cheap feeling IMO.
Most of the other pairs of canvas pants I've bought have been around $25, these were $40...I'd much rather buy two pairs of other brands for only $10 more than the Carhart's.  I feel like I'm spending $15 on the Carhart name and not for added quality or craftsmanship.

"I've worn Carhartt's my whole life, excellent pant. This version is *not* their ultra tough version so don't expect great durability. These are more for going around town, not working.

"For the price, I expected better quality.  After a few washings, the color runs off the thigh areas and mostly at the knees just like a cheap jeans.  This undesirable effect is much more pronounced in the darker colors (e.g. Navy blue or black).  The pants looks old after just a few washings because of the inconsistent color loss.

After a few more washings, the material starts to fray, tear and deteriorate along the edges of the pockets and at the bottom of the legs.

The only improvement to these pants would be to remove the ""hammer loops"", as they get in the way of the cell phone and utility pockets (or you can just cut them off like I did).  I had never purchased a Carhartt product before these and now that's all I wear! Best all around work pants I own",5.0
"I'm peeved that these are $10 less than I paid.
These are not made in the US now, mine were made in Mexico.

They seem to be good quality, great loose fit in the crotch, legs and back end. I like the 2 side pockets and loops, my smart phone fits in one and a can of snuf in the other.
The seams and stitching looks uniform, my only complaint is one side pocket was to tight for my phone.
I ordered the navy blue for 2 pairs, mistake there it showed up everything. I
thought I'd put them in a light bleach wash to dull em out. They came out a duck jean color, I like it better. Most comfortable jeans I've had",5.0

I love these pants! I run a pest control company and constantly have to work in crawl spaces and around houses. I have beat the crap out of them many times  and they look better all the time. I now own 3 pairs but my favorite are my oldest( broke in ) pair. They look thin compared to other carhartt's but don't let the thinner feel fool you. They will hold up to whatever damage you put them through and will still look great. I get many compliments on them and plenty of attention from women. I don't see myself going back to jeans  or other pants anytime soon. Best pants I have ever owned!,5.0

For Carhartt (Loose Fit pants) I ordered one size larger [than Wrangler] based on customer reviews / recommendations (from Amazon, Sierra Trading Post, and Working Person Store) and this hindsight worked perfectly; 42X34 fits great. The pants are SOOOO comfortable and give a very-very good amount of crotch room (you won't be adjusting your underwear / removing weggies every time you sit down / stand-up).

*If you like Wrangler Loose fit products and HATE having inadequate crotch-room I highly recommend these pants, just order one size larger (in the waist) than your normal size. Hope this helps! Very roomy and comparable to Wrangler- RIGGS brand",5.0

"I've been wearing Carhartt work pants for at least a decade or more. In the past I've experienced extremely high durability in their Dungaree pants with the double layer front legs which are perfect on cold winter work days but, just waaaaaay too HOT in the spring/summer.

Use for Sat installation and hold up really well to snags or sharp objects. If I had been wearing my Levis I would have had to replace many of times. They do not hold up to well to stains like grease or oils too much A real hard cleaning is needed for that and they do tend to fade some. Other than that I will continue to purchase Great Quality,5.0
"I have about 8 pair of carhartt pants in three different styles that I wear the same size in. They all fit great. These pants are just exactly how they are described. Low waist, which translates to low sagging crotch which makes inseam hang two or three inches longer at my feet. Material was great.

It isn't really a charcoal color as you can see by the photo, but that is fine with me. The ""cell phone pockets"" are kind of useless with any newer phone, but I like the look anyway.

"I ordered a charcoal color of these pants a while back.  They fit OK.  I usually order the thicker material pants from Carhartt and they always fit perfectly around the butt area.  I ordered a pair of ""Golden Khaki"" colors of these last week, assuming that they would be similar to the charcoal ones.  Looks like they are literally, no exaggeration, cut for women with extra large behinds.  Several washes in hot water and hot drier cycle do not seem to have made a difference.  Unfortunately I already cut those two funky side loops off as I usually do to Carhartt pants, so cannot return them.  They are sitting on my donation to charity pile right now. Charcoal color fit OK, Golden Khaki is Custom Cut & Made for Kardashian Sisters.",1.0
"The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that I did manage to wear these out. Although it took much longer to do that than other pants I've had in the past, I did manage to wear them out. I own 4 pairs of these pants and it took me about 4 months to wear out one pairs.
On Carhartt's website they go for $48 plus about $12 for processing and shipping. So the total ends up at $60. When I saw them on Amazon Prime for $39 I was pretty stoked. It's a great deal.
They are super comfortable and contrary to the general consensus of Carhartt being stiff and rough pants, these are actually very soft and flexible. I will definitely be buying more. Pretty much the only pants I wear and will ever buy",4.0

"I ordered these pants in the Dark Brown color today (June 26, 2013). I was very excited as I love this brand of pant. As I placed my order the pants showed as being ""in stock"" (and still do by the way). A couple hours later I received an email from Midwest Workwear informing me that my color choice was not in stock and wouldn't be until the Fall. They did offer me some other color choices, but none in which I had interest.

I canceled my order and now have to wait for a refund of my funds (some in the form of a gift card for my birthday). I wish that Midwest Workwear would have policed their offering on Amazon providing accurate information on what is actually available. Perhaps when they see this feedback they will. Disappointed with Midwest Workwear",3.0
"I am a forester and work outside in very hot weather. These are the best pants I've ever worn - I own 4 pairs. Carhartts aren't cheap, these are worth it. They are heavy duty, and breath pretty well. They dry pretty fast - if you've ever worked a Louisiana forest in July you know what I'm talking about.

These are a little baggy so a 30 inch waist hangs a little loose -- plenty of legroom for moving around. I wear them when climbing, but the legs are a little loose for that. Lightweight and strong",5.0

"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants. Run a little tight, but good",4.0

After looking for a time I have found a replacement for my carpenter pants that are wearing out. I have purchased both the relaxed and loose fit jeans to help me decide what works as a year round work jean. The loose is much better for the cold weather (due to layers) and leave lots of room to still feel comfortable throughout my day. The relaxed is a slightly tighter fit. I prefer the loose.

Fit looks good, even at the end of the day, compared to most jeans.  Very comfy, fits good but can still move around. I like 'em",5.0
"Because of other's reviews of this product I had some difficulty choosing the right size. Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well. Nice looking pants, sizing problems",5.0

I'll start by saying that the sizing is def. different than other brands. I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants. Perfect work pants,5.0

I laundered with confidence, as I always do - cold wash/delicate dry - and was shocked when I put these on.  Way too tight in the waist could barely breathe.

"I love these, but THEY DO SHRINK considerably lengthwise, so order them long:

I had three pairs of these that fit perfectly when I first got them, but after several months I noticed my ankles were drafty.  I got out the measuring tape and my nominally 30"" inseams (which started out closer to 31"") now measured just 28"".  This happened to all 3 pairs after maybe 15 laundry cycles.  I wash and dry them in compliance with the laundry label, and they do just fine, but they apparently come out just a tiny bit shorter each time.  (I have not noticed any shrinking of the waistband; they only seem to shrink noticeably in length, thankfully...)

They're very comfortable pants, with sufficient room in the crotch and thighs to let you sit and crouch and move around without restriction, so I ordered three more pairs in the same exact colors---but this time with a 32"" inseam.  I measured the inseams when I received them, and found them all to be a little under 33 inches in reality.  I then washed them, and this time I intentionally dried them in a hot drier to speed up the shrinking process.  Sure enough they are all already a full 1"" shorter, at around 32"" now.

I expect these 3 new pairs to continue to shrink over the next six months in the normal laundry cycle until they are about 3"" shorter than they started, which is 30"" and perfect on me.  (That's 3"" total shrinkage from the 32"" inseam, which when measured was actually 33"" to start with.)

So do buy these pants---you'll love them---but buy them 2"" longer than you usually wear.  Then just give them time (or a few hot dryer cycles), and they will shrink to your perfect length. Order 2"" longer than you need",5.0

Very nice, I hope that these will get looser over time. the rest of the fit looks sharp. These wear like iron, I have gotten this pant for years. The more you wash em the better they look and fit.

"Hi!! I'm Stephanie and work for Doug, a plumber.  I found this style of work pants for him and ordered them many years ago and now he won't wear anything else but these!! Nothing even comes close to them.  He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these...it really made my day! :) Everything about them...he loves but the pockets are the real deal for him!  He loves the way that they curve! So over the years, I've continued to purchase these pants for him along with the same style shorts with the same pockets.  It really breaks my heart that the shorts are no longer available to get.  He worries that he won't be able to get the pants one day as well... so please keep on selling them.  If anyone knows where I can get the Carhartt Men's Canvas Utility Shorts....please let me know!! I've searched the whole internet and still have not been able to locate any of them anywhere :(!! My boss is very upset about that too! I've even called Carhartt head quarters trying to see if they would just make him several years supplies for him but they could not do it! :( I pray that these pants will stay in stock and not be unavailable because my boss will not be a happy man and neither will I because I will have to listen to him complaining everyday about his work pants like he is already complaining about not being able to get the shorts anymore because they are not making them anymore!  Thanks for 2 great items and hopefully those shorts will be made available to purchase again very soon so that I can be happy and my boss can be too! :)  Thanks and have a great day! :) By the way....We both give this product a 5 STAR!!!! ***** He's very hard to please and when he said that he loved these.",5.0
"Hmmm. Well the pants fit great. I have a problem with the pant legs pockets layout. I'm used the right pocket holding my spare pencils, instead that's the pocket they designed for a cellphone. Then they put the hammer loop right above it, so every time I went to get my cellphone my hand would get slightly entangled in the loop.  I solved the problem with the loop by cutting it off.

Size 40 fits fine, but Carhartt's ""36"" would have been impossible for me to wear. The company should really look into correcting their measurements. Just a head's up. Buy two sizes up",4.0

"Great fit in the leg (I have large legs) and as others said the waist is a bit tight so I ordered the next size up, I normally wear a 34x32 in Carhartt denim pants, so I got these in 35x32. These are noticeably tighter in the waist and I probably should have gotten a 36. The inseam was a bit long too; these are at least 1-2 inches longer when compared to the denim. Also, the seat feels a bit cramped when sitting.

Size aside, these are noticeably cooler (temperature) than denim. The leg pocket is a perfect fit for an iphone 6 without a case. They feel really well build, however the sizing is greatly different from Carhartt's denim sizing. I'm not certain I'll be ordering these again. poor sizing, but very breathable pants.",3.0

"Comfortable, durable, well constructed.

But I wish the cell phone pocket on the right side were bigger and more secure. The other Carhartt pants I own have a deeper phone pocket and a shallow fabric ""lip"" that prevent the phone from sliding out. Honestly, that pocket is the reason I bought another pair of pants from this company.

However, the phone pocket in this pair is about a half inch too shallow for my Nexus 6. My phone falls out EVERY SINGLE TIME I sit down on my office chair, every time I depress the gas pedal in my car, every time I move my right leg to any angle that is more than 90 degrees to the floor. This is a deal breaker for ""work"" pants. I've only worn these pants for one day and I've already almost broke my phone twice. I really like my phone and I don't like the sound it makes as it bounces off concrete...

I know this pocket probably wasn't designed just to hold a phone. But let's face it, 95% of people are going to stick their phone in there.

Disappointing. I'm not going to through the pants out but I can not wear them for work. Good pants. But I wish the phone pocket were bigger and more secure...",3.0

"This cut is for below the wais by design by Carhartt - and as such they fit as expected. Nice loose fit on the legs.

Do remember to check Carhartt's guides as the ""Regular"", ""Relaxed"", ""Loose"" aren't just the diameter - they affect where the belt sits. Above, at, or below the natural waist.

With a few more chest pounds than I'd like I need the belt just below the natural waist . This ""Loose Fit"" is designed to sit right there. Loose fit is perfect cut for us heavier guys.",5.0

"I normally wear a size 42x30 in jeans, however when I received my pair of these Carhartts they were much too small.

Its obvious that they are really well made, and are sturdy for day to day work. I was a bit bummed that they didn't fit, but i liked them enough to re-order another pair.

These are comfortable pants. They are 100% cotton so I'm not sure how long they will last if you are doing outdoor work or looking for a pant that will be rugged. I'm also not sure where they get these pants sized because they are far from correct. I wear a 32 waist jean and 32-33 waist in slacks. I first ordered a 34 waist after reading others having size problems. I could not even get them over my hips. Sent them back and got 36 waist. They barely fit and since they are cotton I know once I wash them they won't fit. Guess I'm going to have to get a size 38. Which is way off from my normal 32 inch waist in all brands of jeans. The length seems to run about an inch or so long but you can shrink them. So length isn't really a issue. I suggest if buying to be prepared to way over size the waist size by at least 3-4 inches.

I have been looking for pants that will work for my husband at work. We searched many many hours both online and off. When we got these he was kind of sceptical about them. I washed them of course and there was a little shrinking but nothing like others I have bought that were made out of the same material. They are a canvas type material that my husband loves because it is tough by he don't get so hot at his job. No one likes swamp backside lol. These fit perfectly and he was very happy. He does wish they were a tiny bit more breathable but overall even on the 125 heat index days which in his job is closer to 150 degrees that he stayed cooler then regular pants. The color is spot on with what we expected. The only complaint he has for his scissors that he has to use for work we have to make the side loops smaller. He does love there is two so he don't have to worry about just putting on the one side it he is working and in a difficult position to put in the one loop. The pockets are holding up perfect as he is tough on them also. Overall he is very happy with this purchase and will be ordering more. This is a regular family purchase for our family. Light weight and perfect for hot jobs,4.0

"Material is good. I always wear a 31x34 Levi 505, which is what I ordered. They were way too long. I tried washing them since they're 100% cotton and they did shrink length-wise, but are still a good 2"" longer than my Levi's. They are also definitely baggy. Too long",3.0
"We're picky about work clothing and have been using Carhartt for years.
Why do these not fit true to size? They are a little small in the waist, necessitating an unbuttoned top button for comfort.

The pants that I was wearing for work all day was 44 X 30.  When got home tried these on.  Could not even get the button close enough on the waist to fasten.

I have a handful of Carhartt pants in several different styles. I have two pairs in this style. All of them fit consistently.  I tried to replace my worn out charcoal loose fit 5 pocket canvas carpenter jeans and received a pair that was far too small through the waist.  I returned them and ordered a replacement and got another pair that was far too small. What do I do? Is it just this style that has shifted sizes? is it just this color?

Hubby does alot of work on his knees, so after several months, the knees do wear out and rip, so it's patch time and they last and last and last.

They don't wrinkle too bad and I haven't had any shrinkage from the wash yet.

"Carhartt makes some great pants, but for me their fit is really tricky. Some of their pants ride up too high on the waist. Some are too tight if you have big thighs like me. These B159 loose fit seem to be the best fitting of all for me. I like the material of these pants - they are canvas, but feel more like smooth denim. And best of all, they are classy enough to wear to work, yet durable enough to wear while doing yard clean up.

One tip - always order one inseam size longer than you normally would, because with all Carhatt products, they shrink a lot after repeated washing & drying!! Excellent fit, high quality, classic look",5.0
"Nicely made pants that fit true to size. For someone in construction, frequently crawling around doing hard labor, they hold up fairly well. I have had to use some patches on the knees occasionally, but all in all Carhartt offers some good  quality products. Nicely made pants that fit true to size",4.0
"The description states:  Loose Fit - and that is what these pants are.  They fit perfectly as expected.  Lots of room to work in them and be comfortable.  This is my 2nd pair.  For work, I love these - feels like the loose coveralls without the bib and the suspenders. Yep - loose and perfect!",4.0

"I am a fairly skinny guy, and very tall as well so it is hard for me to find pants. The pants fit fairly well around the waist, but I just felt like they were too baggy in the leg.

Not bad, but not for me",3.0

"I love Carharrt's quality, but for some reason each color pant fits differently even though they are the same model.

UPDATE: I contacted Carhartt about the sporadic size differences for the same model (but different color). The representative was very friendly and helpful. They offed to inspect the pants and if there is an issue they will replace with new. If you want to send them back to corporate make sure you have all the details. Size, Model, Color that you will be sending back to them.

From experience the darker the color the tighter the fit. I don't know why this is. Quality great. Sizing sporadic.",4.0

"Bought these pants for work. I wear a 33x32 for most everything. These pants are way big in the legs, the waist is too big and they're too long. I thought they would shrink up a bit but they didn't. If I had to buy these again I'd go with a smaller size because these ended up being too baggy on me. They've been in fairly consistent use and are now starting to wear out after about a year. Overall, they're good pants but I would definitely order the next size down. Others have said they run big or run small so go try them on in a store before purchasing.

"I bought two pairs of these because I know my exact size which is usually enough to buy without needing to try the pants on.

The first pair I got, Mushroom, were much longer than the listed inseam, I'm stepping on them every step, so either I return or pay for the them to be tailored.

The second pair (navy blue) I already bought before I wore the first pair and they were also too long but not like the first pair, both pants exact same listed sizes (the labels), it was this product so they are both the same line, same model just different colors.

I've never had the listed inseam so wrong this tells me they have zero QA process and I want to let people know, I'd stay away at all costs.  Both pairs unwearable, did not match at all the listed inseam, and also the pairs were different lengths from each other, what's going on?  It costs me a lot to have these tailored and they aren't worth it but I need pants and I already lost enough time on this. The length is very inaccurate, way off!!!",2.0

"The rise of these pants is incredibly high. Walking was uncomfortable because I couldn't take full steps which made me look like I'd just messed myself. Additionally I need to be able to straddle roof ridges for wok and without hiking these up over my belly button there was no way to accomplish that.

Love the material and Carhartt has such great customer service I hate to complain but if they could cut these like the #101118 jeans that'd be awesome & I'd buy 4-5 pairs and wear them to work every day. So far I've found this to be a problem with Carhartt's products designed for work. Very tight in the pocketed area and very high cut. Different material but basically cut like mom jeans. Feels like Mom Jeans",3.0
They are OK. Kinda flimsy construction. I've had them for about 6 months and they are already pretty worn. The right thigh pocket re-inforcement gets all bunched up and annoys the crap out of me.

"Just like the others say, it runs small in the waist. I saw this and ordered larger than I normally wear. It still fits too snug for my liking and I need to go up two inches in the waist for comfort - which is going to be almost 3-4 inches above what I wear in other clothes. Also the zipper is not very long so there is not much room for the stuff down there...and I am a very average sized guy but I can tell before washing these pants that we are going to have a problem with the lack of room in the zipper area.
Now the pants look and feel great, nice and light, good length, they are sort of baggy in my opinion but not much at all, just loose fitting. So I will try again with a larger size or try the regular fit. Too small in the waist and zipper areas",4.0

"Every pair of jeans I own is a 40 waist (which for me is about a half size to big) and I like the way they fit. I tried these on at a local store and I couldn't even fasten the 40 waist. They didn't have a 42 in the store so I ordered a 42Wx32L from Amazon and they fit me exactly how I would have expected the 40 to fit. From the sounds of other reviews it appears to me that the closer you get to a 30 waist the more true they fit. So, choose wisely.  Comfortable light material and they seem to be constructed very well. The Canvas really just feels like thin denim. The real reason I'm reviewing these pants is to let my fellow ""big men"" out there know that if your like me and have bigger muscular thighs and have a hard time finding truly loose fitting pants, look no further. I have tried on dozens of supposedly loose fitting jeans from every brand imaginable with nearly all fitting me like 80's style 501s (or rodeo style Wranglers for the country folks). These are the baggiest pair of pants I have owned since me beloved Silver Tab Baggy and Lucky 48 ""Fat Boy Fit"" jeans were discontinued. Now if Carhartt would just make this cut in a standard 5 pocket jean with some nice dark washes I be set for life. I do feel compelled to warn all the slim guys out there that, your little birdie legs will probably be ""swimming"" in these jeans and I'd go with Carhartts ""relaxed"" fit instead. (A little side note to the big men. I have also found that Wrangler 20X style 33 ""extreme relaxed"" jeans also fit me and my bigger thighs well) Paging Mr. Big Thighs......We have your pants!",5.0

I wear these to work and they fit sort of loose which I find more comfortable for all day use. I got a hole in them somehow in the first week but no issues since then. Great work pants,4.0

Great transaction - simple & right Five Stars,5.0
I've purchased these before fit good comfortable and they have high back. Sick of low cut any thing. As a builder you put things in the pockets and pulling your pants up every two seconds gets old. These stay up. Great fit and comfortable.,5.0
"Should have bought these before I ever started landscaping. Best pants on Earth. Hold up to anything. Fit incredibly comfortable - no restriction of movement like jeans. I've got muscular legs that normally don't comfortable fit jeans, but these are great without being baggy.

You can wear them for days at work before having to switch to the next pair. I have 3 pairs now and never run out doing laundry once a week. Just hang them up after a day of work and put them right back on the next day with a little dirt on them, but these colors make it hard to see. Once they're noticeably dirty or get wet, I wear the next ones.

Have yet to notice any wear to any of my pairs after a few months of use. Best pants on Earth",5.0
I was charged $5.00 handling for something I could not use.  They were too small & the material was too thin.  It was a bad experience. Too little...Too thin....Too bad,1.0

"Pants look fine but I am done ordering Carhartt pants on-line. Stupid me. I have tried on 3 different occasions now and every time have had to return them. I'm a 33"" waist so ordered 34"". I couldn't get close to buttoning them. I'd probably need 36"" waist for them to fit me. Be very cautious of size on these pants. I've given up.

"I love some aspects of these pants and hate others.
The fit/cut is excellent. If you love the old Levi's 560 (Loose Fit) before Levi's started using cheaper materials, less quality control and changed the cut, you will love these pants. They are extremely comfortable.
On the downside, they are incredibly prone to wrinkle up. I need to iron them after every time I wear them (which is obviously ridiculous). In fact, even after a couple of hours, you already see very visible wrinkles. No other pants I have ever had needed anything like this. I wish the firm fixed this. I believe there are fabric treatments that can greatly help this and are not too costly. Great fit but terrible tendency to wrinkle",3.0

"I was nervous about the sizes on these pants due to many reviews, but I still ordered my usual size and they fit perfect.  They are very comfortable and feel very durable. They fit over my work boots without any issues and the pockets are deep which I like. Ordered a second pair because I like them so much. Best work pants!!!!",5.0

"Who makes these pants? They are NOT canvas, as I usually wear from Carhartt, and I can't see them lasting more than a month!
These are very light weight- made for summer months, perhaps. And they would still wear out fast. Lighter than denim.
I am very disappointed, as I need real work clothes right now for the winter months. First time I received anything sub-par from Amazon.

My husband is tall and sometimes difficult to fit.  His inseam is 34 inches which can be hard to find on the shelf with his waist size--I won't reveal that to prevent him getting upset with me.:)  The fabric is a sturdy weight yet flexible and moves with him.  He's very happy with the multiple pockets too.  We will definitely be purchasing more. Fits perfectly,4.0

"Loose fit I found out is bigger down the legs than I anticipated.  I feel like I'm wearing bell bottoms.  The ""relaxed fit"" is actually tapered a little bit and fit me great.  I bought two pairs of pants from Carhartt not paying attention to the style.  I'm not sure I'll like the ""loose fit"" (they will be washed & dried before I wear them) but I know I'll like my ""relaxed fit"" carpenter jeans. This is a ""loose fit""",3.0

"It is quite difficult to find pants that fit what I would call a normal man, they all seem to be incredibly tight around the thighs and crotch area it's as if man hating women design pants for men these days leaving us real men with no room for our man parts with all of these ""skinny jeans"" NO real men wear skinny jeans. We need a little room.
Well guys, look no further, I have found the quintessential work pants for the real men that are left with their parts intact.
Very comfortable in all the important areas, and great for carpenters (of which I am one) hammer holsters, a few pockets for a utility knife or other hand tools and they appear to be tough, time will tell.
Do yourself a favor and try a pair. Great work pants.",5.0

"I work in the construction field, and I'm constantly having trouble with jeans tearing, especially now when even good old reliable Levis are thin as paper. I used to wear Silver Tab Levi's, but the cut of the jean is now so messed up I can't fit into them and feel comfortable. So I ordered two pairs of these Carhartts, and I couldn't be happier. Just remember, like others have said, get the waist one size bigger, and the length one size shorter, and they should fit you as expected. Great work pants (and even casual wear)",5.0

"I've bought a few pairs of canvas pants from other brands and have been really happy with them.  So I figured that spending the extra money on a pair of Carhart's might be worth the extra money, I was very disappointed in the quality of the fabric, very thin and cheap feeling IMO.
Most of the other pairs of canvas pants I've bought have been around $25, these were $40...I'd much rather buy two pairs of other brands for only $10 more than the Carhart's.  I feel like I'm spending $15 on the Carhart name and not for added quality or craftsmanship.
I'm going to return these. Thin material",2.0

"I hate trying to find pants that fit, a size 40 is always too big and a 38 always seems to be too tight even relaxed fit but, these size 38 loose fit we're just right. I was nervous buying them online without trying them on but, if you have the same problem as I do when trying to find pants that aren't as tight as a 38 original or relaxed and not as loose as a size 40 try these out. Great fit for someone between a size 38-40",4.0
"OH my goodness, my first Carhartt that my husband hated. It runs WAY small, he is definitely a 38 waist and has trim legs and is tall. He couldn't get these past his calf! Loose-Fit, in what universe? Had to return, thank goodness the refund was quick. Husband Hated This Pant",1.0
"I've worn Carhartt's my whole life, excellent pant. This version is *not* their ultra tough version so don't expect great durability. These are more for going around town, not working.

The one problem I found is they're HUGE! Both in length and width, these are far too big compared to other Carhartt pants I've bought in the same exact size. Make sure to drop one size if you buy these. Loose Means Loose",2.0
"Great product, great deal!!!! Ya dat",5.0
"The limiting factor on pants is crotch room.  If it ain't there, it ain't gonna work.  These are not absurdly baggy, but they do give just a bit of extra room there so I'm not squeezed.  Very comfy.  The material is a little stiff at first but softens nicely.  Like any cotton pants, the pants length shrinks a good inch or more, but the waist (and crotch length) remains unchanged.  I bought a second pair. Room where a man needs room",5.0

"For the last 10 years I have bought all my work clothes from Duluth Trading, sadly each year the prices went up until finally they priced themselves out of my life. I bought these pants from Amazon at a great price, and I will tell you I love them. I have been wearing them 10 hours a day for two weeks, they are the right size and very comfortable for me. Very comfortable pants",5.0
"This is my second pair. After reading reviews at first I ordered one inch larger in the waist. Fit well but a little large in waist. This time I ordered my size. The same size I wear in Boss, Levis, and everything else. Fits perfect!

To those that say these pants are small, I'd took a look at the bathroom scale. Then head to the gym. The Best Work Pant Ever!",5.0
"For the price, I expected better quality.  After a few washings, the color runs off the thigh areas and mostly at the knees just like a cheap jeans.  This undesirable effect is much more pronounced in the darker colors (e.g. Navy blue or black).  The pants looks old after just a few washings because of the inconsistent color loss.

After a few more washings, the material starts to fray, tear and deteriorate along the edges of the pockets and at the bottom of the legs.

If you are looking for a heavy-duty durable pair of pants for work, this brand is not for you. Color runs like a typical jeans, material not durable",1.0
"I purchased these to be work pants worn as a DIY'er home renovator.  The fabric is just swiss cheese after about a dozen wearings.

These pants from Carhartt are not only functional and durable, they're damn good looking. The colors they come in are neutral, but attention grabbing. I've already had a few people ask me where I got my pants from. They go good with pretty much any shoe/shirt combo.

The loose-fit provides plenty of room, but not baggy. I love the small side pocket for my phone without making these pants look like cargo pants. The sizing was spot on for me. At 40 dollars, it's a bit more than I'd like to spend, but I find these are worth it. I like these pants so much, I bought 3 more pair. Finally found a good pair of pants",5.0

"I love the way these pants fit for me. I have larger than average thighs and butt (thank you powerlifting), so it can sometimes be a challenge to find trousers that fit comfortably. I appreciate that these have the room that I need without my having to buy a bigger waist size and cinch it in with a belt.

The fabric seems more durable than other brands of demin I have tried, but magically, it is softer than expected. I will certainly buy these again before I buy another pair of Wrangler or Levi. Great fit for a muscular frame",5.0

"Lots of subtle pockets on both hips are what makes these pants nice.  Many of us need those extra pockets for things like, keys, wallet, phone, large pocket knife, mini pocket knife, pistol, etc.  These pants accommodate your EDC every day carry items.

"It seems that Carhartt has compromised with quality in an effort to stay competitively priced, like most manufactures are doing now.
It's happening with most products. Packages have become smaller, quantities are less, etc. to keep the price the same. I purchased these very pants 2 years ago and the fabric is MUCH thinner, although it says canvas. I have struggled to find a durable work pant in my size, and thought Carhartt was my best option until now. Unfortunately, Carhartt has discontinued my size, therfore I thought I would buy all 3 pair. I also ordered from another supplier who indicated that they could not fulfill the order due to the size being discontinued. I do not plan to return these because they fit. My experience with the seller is not the issue, but thought they should be aware.

I was surprised to see they make 31x32 so I bought a pair. I was worried they would become too tight after washing, but when washed and dried these fall right within the exact size they specify. These pants are durable, nice looking, nice fitting and last awhile. This is the 3rd pair to my collection because these pants are clearly made to last. You get what you pay for with these.

The pants are SOOOO comfortable and give a very-very good amount of crotch room (you won't be adjusting your underwear / removing weggies every time you sit down / stand-up).

Use for Sat installation and hold up really well to snags or sharp objects. If I had been wearing my Levis I would have had to replace many of times.

"I have about 8 pair of carhartt pants in three different styles that I wear the same size in. They all fit great. These pants are just exactly how they are described. Low waist, which translates to low sagging crotch which makes inseam hang two or three inches longer at my feet. Material was great.

"I ordered a charcoal color of these pants a while back.  They fit OK.  I usually order the thicker material pants from Carhartt and they always fit perfectly around the butt area.  I ordered a pair of ""Golden Khaki"" colors of these last week, assuming that they would be similar to the charcoal ones.  Looks like they are literally, no exaggeration, cut for women with extra large behinds.  Several washes in hot water and hot drier cycle do not seem to have made a difference.  Unfortunately I already cut those two funky side loops off as I usually do to Carhartt pants, so cannot return them.  They are sitting on my donation to charity pile right now.

"The only thing keeping me from giving this five stars is that I did manage to wear these out. Although it took much longer to do that than other pants I've had in the past, I did manage to wear them out. I own 4 pairs of these pants and it took me about 4 months to wear out one pairs.
On Carhartt's website they go for $48 plus about $12 for processing and shipping. So the total ends up at $60. When I saw them on Amazon Prime for $39 I was pretty stoked. It's a great deal.
They are super comfortable and contrary to the general consensus of Carhartt being stiff and rough pants, these are actually very soft and flexible. I will definitely be buying more. Pretty much the only pants I wear and will ever buy",4.0

"I ordered these pants in the Dark Brown color today (June 26, 2013). I was very excited as I love this brand of pant. As I placed my order the pants showed as being ""in stock"" (and still do by the way). A couple hours later I received an email from Midwest Workwear informing me that my color choice was not in stock and wouldn't be until the Fall. They did offer me some other color choices, but none in which I had interest.

I canceled my order and now have to wait for a refund of my funds (some in the form of a gift card for my birthday). I wish that Midwest Workwear would have policed their offering on Amazon providing accurate information on what is actually available. Perhaps when they see this feedback they will.

"I like carpenter pants for the pockets - they have more utility than ""cargo"" pants, for me. To work I've been wearing Wal-Mart store brand carpenter jean, 15 bucks a pair, because I like the pocket configuration and they are cheap, but I wanted something more durable. Wranglers were out - they only have one leg pocket!

These run a bit tight in the waist - I ordered two inches larger than my typical waist size and they fit perfectly out of the dryer.

The right hand side leg pocket has a reinforced seam at the opening, which makes the clip of a multitool or folding knife a bit snug to slip on or off. But it won't get frayed or torn up anytime soon. Typical carpeter pants have a ruler pocket with diagonal opening and a square tape measure pocket on the right side, but these have the reinforced cell phone pocket. It works ok for my purposes, it's where I clip my leatherman tool and stow screwdrivers or wrenches if I need a free hand and don;t want to set them down (I always lose track if I set them down somewhere.)

The left pocket is a more traditional sewn on square of cloth, like traditional carpenter pants. It holds a small flashlight just fine, and a flat cell phone.

These pants have hammer loops on both legs, not just the left leg like most carpenter pants.

The canvas duck fabric is lighter than I expected, which IMO is a good thing, but still seems a lot more durable than the denim you get in most jeans.

I am disappointed at how small the right side ""change"" or ""watch"" pocket is, compared o most carpenter jeans. Items that ride comfortably in the watch pocket of my other carpenter jeans either don't fit, or ride up and dig into my side, if I stick them in the change pocket of these pants.

After looking for a time I have found a replacement for my carpenter pants that are wearing out. I have purchased both the relaxed and loose fit jeans to help me decide what works as a year round work jean.

"Because of other's reviews of this product I had some difficulty choosing the right size. Some reviewers said that they needed to order several sizes larger in order to get the right fit so I initially ordered a size 35x32. I'm a tall, skinny guy and I typically wear pants with a size 32 or 33 waist. 35 turned out to be about three inches too large so I exchanged them for a size 33, which fits comfortably, but definitely requires a belt. I think a size 32 would have fit perfectly. The exchange process was quick and simple and the new size arrived faster than my initial order. I would recommend that other customers buying these pants order the size they usually wear and make an exchange if those don't fit. As of writing this review, I have only worn these pants long enough to determine the size and fit. I may write an update later with my experience of their quality, especially if it turns out to be lacking.

EDIT: 12/13/13, They continue to be excellent. Keep in mind that if using these for work darker colors will be less prone to stains and dirt, however, even Carhartts in lighter colors clean up well. Nice looking pants, sizing problems",5.0

I'll start by saying that the sizing is def. different than other brands. I was hesitant to purchase these online after reading the reviews about the sizing problems. I decided to buy them anyways and was prepared to exchange them if they didn't fit. I normally wear a 34/32 but ordered a pair of these in 38/32. When I receieved them and tried them on they were a little big in the waste but nothing a belt wouldn't fix. After washing and drying them they did shrink a little bit. I have to say that these are the most comfortable work pants I have worn. When they say loose fit they really mean it. They are very roomy but not to the point where they are baggy. They also have a few handy pockets for a utility knife/screwdriver or even a cell phone. I just placed an order for 4 more pairs in various colors so I have a pair for each day of the work week. The only problem I have noticed is that they seem to come out of the drier very wrinkled but it is not a big deal. Overall I would reccomend these pants. Perfect work pants,5.0
"Carhartt jeans are high quality, and the loose-fit Carpenter model is a very good all-round choice. They are durable enough to wear while performing manual labour, and elegant enough to use at a formal occation. New favourite pants",5.0
"These are thin and not what I expected,more like slacks. I prefer the heavy duck type. My bad for this one. I'm sure they are of good quality if these are what your looking for. carhartt jeans",1.0
"Great quality slacks, I love the fit, length, sturdiness, etc.  Too bad Carhartt changed the front leg velcro-ed pockets.  They used to be full cut velcro across the top -- easily to slip my mobile or a pad into.  Now the pocket is a weird slanted-3/4-cut velcro, and it's trickier to slip my mobile, etc into.  Maybe more resistant to being nicked, but I preferred the older style.  Still a terrific slack, and my favorite. Love the Fit; Don't like the new pockets",4.0
My husband is very happy with the comfort and practicality of these pants.  I am happy that they wash well and they look good on him. nice pants,5.0
"After brand jumping for years, I've settled on Carhartt for everything I wear. My only regret is that I don't live in a colder climate to wear their winter outdoor gear. This stuff is SUPER well made, and will last a long time, even on a farm. Carhartt is great stuff",5.0

"Lightweight, durable, they fit well and are very comfortable. I can wear them all year. The side pocket fits a cell phone and the loops fit a paintbrush or hammer.

First-these pants do not even come close to the Carhartt's I have purchased in the past.  It really makes me wonder if they are real Carhartts.  Second the sizing is not even close!  If you take a 36 waist and you order a 36 be prepared to send them back.  Even though they will be marked as a 36 they will seem more like a 32 waist Waste of money,1.0
"I have been shopping for a dress skeleton watch for some time and stumbled onto the EE Dorado. I'd not heard of this company before, so I checked their website (they are a long-established German watch manufacturer), so I took a chance. This watch is a BEAUTY! It's far and away the best looking ""skel"" I've found for the price, and if the almost $800 retail price is to be believed (MSRP on watches is highly inflated), then this watch is a steal. The only other watch I was considering was an Android with a metal bracelet (an entirely different look) and at almost twice the price. I did notice there is no country of manufacture shown anywhere on the watch or the packaging. Although this is a German company, it makes me wonder if they are making these in China or someplace overseas. I've got only a few complaints-the clasp is difficult to open/close and the gold hands can be difficult to see (no contrast with the gold mechanism and no illumination). However, I'm so mesmorized by the sheer elegence of this watch, I really don't mind. Beautiful wooden box, too! A real keeper that I'd highly recommend. The vendor was also very prompt with shipping-it even came insured. Must have watch",5.0
"I looked for a good deal of time for a skeleton dress watch and I am truly happy I purchased the Dorado. After over 2 years of ownership it still looks great (actually the watch looks better in person than it looks in Amazon's pictures) and hasn't skipped a beat. I am always amazed at the number compliments I get when wearing it. This was my first watch with a deployment style buckle. It took a little while to get used to it, but now I think it's the only style of buckle I'd have on a watch. No more dropping the watch on the floor when trying to put it on and it also keeps the leather strap from wearing out at the buckle. The watch also comes with an impressive wood gift box. All things said I give the Dorado a 5 star recommendation for quality, value and good looks. Excellent watch, excellent value",5.0
The watch is more of a dirty Chinese watch. I worked well for a day and hasn't worked after that. Don't know what to do with it. Paid an extra 4500/- ($80) for courier charges. Shame. It company is a fraud company.,1.0
"The design, for real and not the picture shown here, is awkward and very embarrassing.  I wouldn't recommend this watch to anyone, not even to my enemies. The worst!!!!",1.0

"Pros:
I bought this watch as a gift for my father and he loved it. In terms of looks, the watch is probably one of the most amazing ones that I've ever seen; It's defiantly far better than any of the mechanical / skeleton watches currently on the market. I looked at hundreds, but this one caught my eye. It's the most ""skeletal"" of the watches, while still retaining elegance.
The picture does not do it justice, it is even nicer in person.
It is shipped in a nice box that has the watch presented on a holder when opened. It defiantly adds to the beauty of the watch.

Cons:
The second, minute, and hour hands can be a little bit hard to see, as it is gold on gold. Some people could have a hard time reading it.
As other people have mentioned, it is not as heavy as it looks.
It is a bit pricey.

Conclusion:
This watch is one that i would recommend buying. It is unlike many that I have seen and would make a great present or nice watch for yourself. It costs more than a lot of watches out there, but it's also a lot cooler than most. In reality the price is cheap compared to other high-end watches. If you're thinking about getting it, i would say go for it, you won't be sorry! Beautiful watch",5.0
"I liked it a lot, nice design and color. I loved the material they used on it. I think people should buy them. AWESOME!",5.0
"The details are amazing and the look is rich and impressive. The watch was quickly delivered and packed with care. It came with a nice box for storage. It is self-winding, just move your arm to keep it running. Beautiful watch",5.0
"I really like this watch. It's an automatic, looks expensive, and definitely gets noticed. I gave it three stars, however, because it stopped working after about 5 months. I don't think anyone cares about the practicality of the watch, but once it stops working completely - rather than just running a few minutes slow - it gets to the point where you'll no longer where it. I really enjoyed the first 5 months though! Good Looks, Not Built to Last",3.0
"It works pretty good and it is quite exact, but... it is engraved on back of it, WATER RESISTANT 3 ATM, I got it for 5 min into the water no deeper than 50cm(children pool) and that was it. Thank you Erik Edelhausen. Not water resistant.",1.0
"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas as he has wanted a skeletal watch for quite sometime and he absolutely loves it! I did a lot of research on skeletal watches before deciding on this one as it was by far the best looking one. And it came out looking even better in person.

The few complaints people had such as the weight and the fact that 4 is written incorrectly as IIII were both accurate however they do not make the watch look any less fancy or cheaper. Everywhere we go he gets compliments and it works and looks fantastic so I don't see any negative things to say about it.

The company also got the watch here faster than the expected delivery date which was impressive considering I ordered it during the holiday season.

All in all a great product and if you're looking for a skeletal watch you can't go wrong with this one. Fantastic!!",5.0
I got it as a gift to my husband and he enjoyed it very much. The watch is worthy and seems to be very luxury. He received so many comments for it. Luxury watch,5.0
"A watch is too light to be made of st. steel, or steel is too thin. Looks small in the hand. More remind an fake what original. 'One of fixative string-courses on a small strap appeared half torn.

"Not worth 198 bucks at all.  It is a pretty watch, I got a lot of compliments for it.  If you look closely at the watch the Roman numeral 4 is IIII rather then IV.  Seriously, how could you get that wrong!  That's a blatant mistake and devalues this watch completely for me.  Check out the photos on the site, every shot you CANNOT see the mistake b/c they KNOW its there and they do not want to show it.  Once you get it and you see it, its a huge disappointment. A watch that's SUPPOSEDLY 600-700 bucks should not have such errors. Very disapointed, considered very ripped off.",2.0
"It Nice shopping experience. I got my watch faster then I expected, and it was nicely packaged. As for the watch itself, its a thing of beauty the first day I put it on and went out had nothing but good complements on the time piece. I'm happy with the shopping experience as well as the product product & shopping experience",5.0
"I gave this watch 4 stars out of 5 which is what it deserves even though I sent mine back.  This is a small watch.  As one reviewer said, some will like it, some won't.  One reviewer stated, ""the case is clunky.""  Not in my way of thinking.  I wish it was.

One reviewer from Moscow says, ""be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract (sic) attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!""  I'm not sure about the situation in Russia but I am inclined to believe that his fantasy is working overtime.  It is a beautiful watch.  I loved this watch and would have kept mine if it had been a larger size.  Because of the size it is definitely an understated watch.

People whine it's light weight, pointers are difficult to see...hey weight is no problem.  Do you want a droopy arm that is sore from a heavy watch?  If it weighed more you would then be complaining about your sore arm or the discomfort of a heavy watch wrapped around your wrist.  Those who complain about pointers difficult to see...again this is the nature of a skeleton watch.  You KNEW this when you ordered it if you looked at the picture and you wouldn't have ordered it if you didn't look at the picture.  The picture definitely has the ""WOW"" factor.

I admit I got carried way in the reviews and the photo of the watch and my imagination sailed away into the wild blue yonder.  Hey, 40mm is 40mm.  Even a 43mm watch is not big but it does show a presence to the wearer and is likely to get noticed.  Again, this is a 40mm watch.  It is a very beautiful watch and you can easily get mesmerized looking at the skeleton workings that are exposed on top and bottom.  If The Eric is reading this, maybe he will be moved to come out with a larger version which of course will up the price beyond the $200 mark. A very beautiful watch.....",4.0
"If your man or you're a man that likes showing off a nice watch that's for you. It's an eye catcher and shiny. Also it's very good quality and comes in a nice box, .. i know,... who cares about the box!
Well, it matters when you give it as a gift!
And if you throw the Bulky box as soon as you get it, you still have a textile glove that will protect it from scratches in your drawer.
I got it for my husband, and he loves it!... He usually likes them thinner, (this one is a little bit bulkier than his usual liking) but this is not for every day, so it's ok!

"This is the sort of watch that will be noticed!
Some will love it, some will hate it and that is seen in these reviews.
Mixed reviews and for a good reason:

This is a beautiful watch, design is awesome, weight is somewhat light but it doesn't feel plastic and that's because it's stainless steel. Not heavy, like some reviewers mention but it i think that makes this watch very confortable exactly because of that.

At this price, i thought it was a good purchase, and i'm very happy with it.
Keeps good time, mine doesn't loose that many minutes as some said but this is not the kind of watch you look for accuracy, it's a fun watch to wear and in that case, it's very cool.
It's flashy, too much perhaps. I agree that this watch seems very ambitious since everyone will notice that golden ""thing"" in your wrist and it certainly seems like a expensive watch.

It has indeed a chinese movement so this is not that great jewerly many were saying it should be but it's not expensive and as such i think people are beeing a bit harsh when saying this is not a high quality piece. You get what you payed for: a fun, cheap enough watch that looks awesome. Design is above all other qualities with this watch but that's ok for the price and i can't find anything like it anywhere! That's great! :) It is unique and impressive!
You will not find another watch in this price range that looks like this. Compact and nice to look at, perfect for parties! ;)

Like our friend from Moscow says, be carefull when using the watch in dangerous places because it will atract attentions and seems very expensive. That could get you to be robbed with such a shiny thing in your wrist!

Pointers are difficult to see in anything but good light but then again, you buy this watch for looks, not function. ;)
Not the easiest watch to wind because crown is too close to case but other than that, i have no complaints.
Nice to have in your collection unless you only like superior, non chinese watches.
Very happy with my purchase, seller was very fast in sending the watch and arrived in perfect condition. Like many said, the wooden box is a delight and i use it ( as manual describes ) to keep some of my unused watches. Impressive!",4.0
"The Dorado watch by Eric Edelhausen looks beautiful. Truth be told, I bought the watch on looks alone. I wanted a big, flashy watch. I assumed (you know what they say about assuming) that all watches kept decent time. I got a big, beautiful, flashy watch. It's self winding, which is a very nice convenience. However, its timekeeping leaves something to be desired. It gains and loses minutes over the course of a week or so. The variance never seems to exceed +/- 5 mins, but if time is of the essence the watch isn't as dependable as it should be for its price. If you do a minute check once a week and make the small adjustment as needed, you'll have a real eye catcher. I'm very happy with my purchase. The ten seconds a week I spend correcting the time is far outweighed by the aesthetics of the watch and the fact that I'll never need to buy a battery for it. Form Over Function",4.0
"I bought this over the internet. So I was not prepared for what was coming at me. Better to buy watches in a store, or at least see them with your own eyes. Too big, too shiny, too ambigiuos - both in the nature of the watch manufacturer, and the time. On the side note,  I am afraid I might get robbed with this shiny thing on my hand. ( I live in Moscow) Considering all the minuses, it is an interesting prototype to have in your collection. Too shiny",4.0
"This watch is as beautiful as it looked online (even moreso, as you can feel it's weight too!).

"Actually I bought this watch for my wife, as her and myself are watch collectors. I have several skeleton watches, and she loves them. She told me that she wanted a skeleton watch, she also wanted an automatic watch. I went to searching since her birthday was coming up soon. Well I went ahead and showed her a pic of the Eric Edelhausen Dorado watch, she said oh I love it. Then I knew I was getting her the right watch. The watch arrived just a couple of days later, she was blown away by it. It is one of her favorite watches. Why do watch companys not make more skeleton watches for women ? I highly reccomend this watch to both men and women. Women now are wearing larger watches these days. My overall experience with Amazon was top notch. I would buy from them again if I see an item that I need. Thanks again, Amazon Just what I was looking for",5.0
"I received this Dorado watch a little over a year ago and it is as stunning to look at today, as it was when I received it as a birthday gift. This is without a doubt the sharpest looking watch I have ever owned and I can't believe the number of compliments I get every time I wear it. I do have to admit that I am not easy on any of the watches I wear; yet this has held up beautifully. We recently purchased another one for our nephew and it was the number one hit gift item at his college graduation party. For good looks, terrific quality and a wonderful value, I recommend it highly. It also comes with a nice wood gift box. Absolutely Stunning, A Must Have Watch",5.0
"I saw the watch and base on the pictures , was very captivated by it. I personally own a BAUME MERCIER Capeland model and was expecting a awesome piece.  here's my thoughts:  I do agree with some reviews about the weight..it feels very light , like there is no substance to it...almost ""plasticky"".  For a retail of $798..I was expecting a heavier watch.
  Other reviews are correct about the time hands blending in with the background...IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE THE TIME.  buy this more for the look , because you will definitely have a hard time see the time hands.
  The packaging is nice with a nice box. The phamplets and manual are very simple, nothing special. No country of origins on anything it comes in. NONE, NADA, ZILCH.
  I actually contemplated sending it bsck because i was dissapointed at first, i decided to wear it for a few days so be sure.
  I found that IT IS VERY EYE CATCHING. people will ask you about it and if you need a conversation starter...this will work. I actually grew to like it and am keeping it. For $198 ( what I paid ) it's not too bad for a watch piece...i don't know if this will be an HEIRLOOM PIECE, i doubt it, but it is nice looking so for sentimental value it does have an appeal.
  It is now part of my wardrobe with my other watches. if you are looking for a skeleton watch, this is not too bad of a choice...it will do fine. If you are expecting too much...this may not be the watch for you.
  but $198 for this watch is fair.  I guess I will recommend it. NICE WATCH....but a slight dissapointment...",3.0
"Let me say that the service from the seller  was great, and very prompt...but to be honest I can't be as enthusiastic as other reviewers. The  packaging is beautiful --- but the watch is quite lightweight --- fine for some I guess - but I expected a more substantial piece. The case is clunky and not particularly aesthetic in design. But for the price? Well I guess what you pay for and for a couple of hundred bucks, I guess its OK... on the other hand I would have serious doubts as to the worth at the claimed RRP, sorry, and I certainly don't conssider it an ""heirloom watch"" Am I being harsh? I really don't think so Its Ok --- but that's it for me",3.0

Wing Collar Tux Shirt was reasonably priced yet high quality with black formal cuff links and studs in place making the ensemble ready to wear upon being taken from it's cellophane wrapping.

"Very nice shirt, but ran WAY too small no the neck.

Advertised size is a bit deceptive, too, since 1/2"" neck sizes are advertised, but not really available. I ordered an 18.5"", but received a 2XL, which also said 18""/18.5"". Had I ordered an 18, it would have been the same shirt.

An 18/18.5 normally is 18.5"" (just as a 34/35 sleeve length really means 35"").  Except this one was even smaller than 18"".  And that was before laundering. No way would it fit someone with an 18.5"" neck.

(Beware, too, that this shirt does not have French cuffs, which any formal shirt should really have, especially a wing collar one. I was aware of this when I ordered, so did not discount my review for that.) Neck opening much smaller than expected",2.0

I purchased a Large at first and had to return it for a Medium. I am usually a 16 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves for my 5' 7"" 170# frame. I found that the Medium shirt (15 1/2 neck and 32"" sleeves) was still a little baggy from under the arms to the waist and little too big in the neck. It also ran a little long. I had it cut flat at the bottom to reduce length and the amount of shirt tail in my pants. Also had sides altered to fit me better. I guess that was about $15.

"I was definitely concerned about buying this shirt because of all of the negative reviews but I figured I would give it a shot anyway since it was priced at less than $14 in my size (171/2, 34-35) and there was an Amazon store that I could return it to if it didn't fit.  Well what a surprise when I got this shirt.  The neck and sleeve sizes fit exactly as expected.  The Pique Bib Front was uniform on both sides (the manuafacturer obviously fixed this issue after all of the bad reviews) and although the shirt is a little thinner than some of the other tuxedo shirts, its not as bad as it was described.

"First off, I loved the quality of this shirt.  It is a beautiful, thick, (but not super thick) soft poly/cotton blend, with a really nice patterned front.  I'm a big guy, usually wearing a size 18.5 - 19 collar. (46 - 48 waist, and I'm only about 6 ft.)  Fearing, that this might run a little small, I went with a sized 20 collar with a 34/35 sleeve.  First off, I was super impressed and happy that this shirt was actually made in that size, so THANK YOU.  That said, the shirt seemed a bit bigger than expected and needed some tailoring to get it right.

In the neck area, I had a little room, making the shirt very comfortable.  Additionally, the sleeves were cut perfectly.  However, the rest of the shirt fit me kind of big and I had to have my tailor both cut the length of the shirt (probably about 3 or 4 inches!) and take the shirt in about 4 inches.  That said, I still ended up with a beautiful, high quality tux shirt, for a very good price.  I would definitely recommend this shirt! I loved the quality of this shirt",4.0

"This is a nice shirt, but the craftsmanship it's there.  The reviews all mentioned the sleeves were too short, so instead of getting 32/33 I got 34/35.  When I tried the shirt it fit well, the only problem is how the bib is not centered.  Probably not really noticeable to most, my girlfriend couldn't tell, but I noticed it immediately since something look crooked.  I even measured it with a tape measure, seem to seem, on both sides and there's up to 5/8th inch deviation.  Other than that it would be perfect.  As long as my jacket is on it won't be noticeable at all.  It's a good back up shirt.  In the picture the quarters are bordering the two seems, notice that the right side of the shirt is narrower that the left.

And after consuming a horse and a half, this shirt will still not feel snug around the waistline.

Seriously though, what is it with dress shirts?  I'm not a stick by any means but there is an extra foot of fabric around the waistline.  Since I have a 36 waist, that means you would need a 48 waist for this to fit properly.  To top it off, all of the fabric that is not in the bib is completely see through.

For under $20 (including shipping) you can get this great looking tie clip that will be the finishing touch to your more formal attire. The clip is a lot shinier than what the picture looks like, so it really looks like it's sterling silver. It is 2.5 inches in length so it might be a bit long for skinny ties. Best thing is, no one will know how much you paid for it (that was my main concern). It also comes in a decent jewelery box. tie clip everyone should have",5.0
"I wanted a simple, plain, handsome tie clip. It's easy to place and

grips just well enough to hold your tie in place in face of errant

tugs and pulls as well as in high winds but it doesn't clamp so

tight to mark or ruin one's more delicate ties made of materials

like silk, etc.

The silver and gold clips are both basic and normal tones that

you would want to go with everything of the like. Look them up.

Great for the price and people can't tell what you paid for the

clip--as they retain their shine. Worth the price ten fold. Great and simple",4.0
I bought this product so many years ago that I don't even remember where -but I found it in my closet the other day and took out some severely tarnished sterling jewelry and followed the directions and it all looks like new now.  Especially good for rope and serpentine chains where those jewelry cloths just can't get into the nooks and crannies.  I think the bad reviewers must not have followed the directions -or used it for something other than silver.  I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to clean silver jewelry -nothing could be easier. BEST thing ever for removing tarnish,5.0
"The other key for me was to use more baking soda than recommended and use boiling water rather than just hot tap water. I also found it works better with a few items at a time rather than ""a whole sinkful."" Also, leave your badly tarnished items in there for awhile. For medium to lightly tarnished items, they'll gleam! Try it a few times on heavily tarnished items",4.0

"After watching Michael Jordon hustle Hanes tee shirts for a few years I decided to give them a try.  The neck does seem to hold its shape better than the Costco brand I have been wearing.  The shirt is much lighter weight than the Costco brand, about 33% lighter by weight and feels flimsey in comparison.  After three washing the shirt appears worn out.  The material is so thin the printed tag can be read from the back through the light weight material.  Some may prefer the light weight as it seems to dry more quickly during exercise.

"I'm 5'2"" and generally wear an xl in tops and bottoms pants are usually a 16 or 18 depending on brand. I carry more weight on the bottom half.
I fit in the top half fits mostly ok. the ""apron ties""  are loose and hang. I have a 38 DDD chest and they lay limp. So I will be reattaching them so it lays nice.
The bottom half fits OK but pulls a little.
The packaging says for the XL size it fits up to size 22. I don't think it would. It's stretchy but the slit might rip and you would probably look like you're in a maid sausage casing. I should also say I tried it on while wearing spanx and a corset. Chest measurement 45"", waist 37"" and hips 52""
My proportions are off for where the waist line hits. It's almost a drop waist on me. And its surprisingly short. I'm short so I figured it would be about knee length. Its easily 4"" above the knee. and then there is the slit- which is almost panty flashing. So I'm wearing a yoga boy shorts so I'm not flashing.
Costume is a kind of cheap but it will work. I wish I didn't spend nearly $50 on it- isn't worth the price. If I hadn't decided to throw a RHPS party in 10 days I probably would have looked elsewhere or asked a local seamstress to make a costume.

"it's a cheap costume wig- sheds, and has a very visible hairline that I suppose you can pick some curls over to disguise. The curls are very tight. the wig is also really shiny and looks more like a bad perm than an afro.

For halloween or on a budget I suppose you could work with it- gently shake some powder into it to dull the shine and pick the curls out just a bit. Otherwise, spend a little more ($20) and get a better synthetic wig- this is junk. the wig is also really shiny and looks more like a bad perm than an afro",2.0

I bought them for myself and a few friends (all a little bigger than me) to wear with tutus and no one will be wearing them. Too Tight!",1.0
"Got a run in the side of it with my first time putting it on.  I don't see how either, it's not like it could have gotten snagged because I was wearing a short dress and I have nubs for finger nails; like seriously, I hate long nails and never let them grow past the skin on the tips of my fingers. Very cheap",2.0
"These stockings say one size fits all and I am by no means a stick figure, but I'm not fat either and these fit nicely except at the top where they started to cut into me after a while. I understand they have to be a bit tight to stay up but after a night at a halloween party, they had rolled up at the top so that they were down below my knees and I had to fidget with them. I feel this is a common problem with this type of stocking though so I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying them based on that. So far they have held up quite well without ripping or tearing and they looked nice on. Nice stockings, kinda tight",3.0
"I bought this for my girlfriend. We both like it. It looks great on her, and she said it felt confortable. Good",5.0
"I got these a couple of months ago and have worn them maybe five or six times since and washed them each time. They held through pretty okay (which is a big deal because the washers and dryers at my school are brutal on clothes) however I was wearing them this week and the foot got snagged on a piece of furniture not even that bad and it tore a huge hole in the top. I'm very disappointed but I guess it adds character. These stockings are probably just better for costumes and if you want some actual striped socks to look for socks instead because these are more like tights.
On the plus side, they stay up really well. Probably better for just costumes",3.0
These are not thick stockings at all - they are like tights. They are also too small for me; I am 5'10 and 200 lbs and pretty proportionate but I can't get these over my knees without them rolling down. NOT one size fits all,1.0

Ordered these thigh-high stockings to go with a sexy Santa outfit that I bought for my wife for Christmas. Instead of stockings they sent me tights. I emailed the seller and they immediately sent me the correct product. Great service and cute stockings. Now if only I could get my wife to wear them... Great stocking - Great service!,5.0

"so I put them on new year's eve and just about cried as they kept rolling down to my knees!!!!
Luckily I remembered I had some matching red/black Garters from Fredrick's, I folded 1"" of the thigh highs over the top of the garters to secure them. I danced all night without another problem! almost tragic",4.0
"I am 5'7""  120 lbs, and they foll down my thighs. When they roll down they bulk up and create this tight band, it hurts! So they are too big, but that causes them to bunch up and become painful. They are very cute though, if they fit you properly. Cute but fit funny",3.0
Bought these for 125-130 pound average size teen girl.  Extremely tight and uncomfortable.  Tops began rolling down to top of knees just walking across the room.  I would not recommend purchase. A waste of money.,1.0

"I am a very small person -- size 0 in jeans, XS/S in most everything else, so when I saw that these were One Size, I was worried they'd be too big for me.  I ordered them because they were the only candy-cane thigh highs I could find which qualified for Amazon Prime, and I needed them fast.  I bought a red garter belt to wear with them under my elf outfit, and I thought they would be really sexy.

The length of these was perfect for me, and the fabric was nice and soft, but the fit around the top of the thigh highs was so tight I almost had to take them off.  They were tight enough to be a little painful, and I threw them out after one wear.  Definitely best to find something you can order in a scaled size, and stay away from these unless you weigh 50 pounds!  (I weigh 100) WAY TOO SMALL!",2.0

"I used these black and white stockings for my American Mcgee's Alice costume. I wore them out for a couple of hours, where I walked around for most of the time. They were quite tight around my thighs, which at first was a bit uncomfortable, but then I got used to it and they were fine. I think the fact they are tight prevents them from falling down when you are walking around a lot. One thing though is that when I sat down they all of a sudden rolled down a bit, so I had to adjust them when I got up. The fabric was comfortable and not too warm, but they are opaque so you don't have to worry about them being see through. They are not perfect, but they served their purpose well and the price is great here on amazon.

PROS:
-Stayed up for hours of walking around.
-Comfortable fabric, not itchy or too warm.
-Opaque

CONS:
-Quite tight around upper legs, will possibly leave some marks.
-Roll down a bit if you sit down. Good with some issues",4.0
"I'm normally a size 2, so when I saw reviews from women who are larger sizes complaining about how tight these are, I dismissed it and assumed it would not apply to me. Unfortunately, it did. When I tried them on, I noticed immediately that they were uncomfortable at the top. I pulled them down to a smaller part of my thigh which helped, but they were still quite tight. I had planned to wear these with a Halloween costume all day at work, but I changed my mind because I did not think I would be able to tolerate them for more than about an hour. They are cute, but not comfortable. Way too tight",2.0
"These were fine until the tops rolled down and they fell all the way down to my ankles. Might have been useful to have a garter belt to keep them up. Other than that, they are super cute and the material is thick enough that it won't snag easily. I would recommend these, but I would also recommend that if you do decide to get them, either have skinny thighs or buy a garter belt to keep them from falling down. :) I've fallen and I can't get up",4.0
Happily surprised--they fit perfectly.  Just the thing for my Halloween-going-to-be-a-witch costume.  I'm a medium and the size matches the label! Perfect,5.0
"""One size fits most""? Hardly. at 118 pounds I would think I'd fit right into the size range... no. No even close. They really need to size these as they do regular stockings/pantyhose. I can't get the top band around my thighs. I do not have crazy large thighs, and I've always worn thigh-highs, but these are ridiculous. Don't misunderstand, they look cute- up to the knees. Don't expect to wear them as shown in the picture unless you have the legs of the girls in the picture. SUPER disappointed. one size?",1.0

"I'm 5'6"", and I found these stockings to come up to just the right height as seen in the stock photographs. I picked a very cute red/black pair, and it went great with my outfit. It was indeed rather tight at the very top, but I found it to become less bothersome as the day went on (I'm not sure whether they stretched out or I just became acclimated to them). They stayed on pretty nicely and securely, and did not find them rolling down. However, at the end of the day, they were still somewhat uncomfortable enough such that it was a relief to take them off. For me though, that's not too bad, and worth the cuteness~ Lovely stockings",4.0
"As with most other stockings, thick legged girls may have trouble with these as ""one size"" works until the thigh. If you have big thighs like me, you may have to cut the tight bit at the top to allow your legs some breathing room. The product itself is okay, though the fabric is thin and obviously not the most durable. Just treat the stockings nicely and they shouldn't rip. Thick legs will have some problems",4.0
I ordered the Lemon yellow and Pink striped socks and they are great. I'm 5'8 and they came up mid-thigh. But unfortunaly they won't stay up. They roll themselves down after awhile of wearing them and they do make my thighs look a little chunky. I'm only 120 pounds and it does make me mildly self-conscious but I found wearing a cute garter belt with them keeps them up and makes my legs look nicer. :) For sure worth the purchase all and all. Super cute :),4.0
"I just recieved the Leg Avenue Women's Nylon B/W Striped Stockings, One Size Fits All. They are exactly as described and I'm VERY happy with them. I just wanted to add a couple little extra notes:
--they came across as pretty opaque (90-95%) but I'm also so pale I'm almost see thru...so whether or not the white would stay 'white' on me was never an issue. I do wonder that anyone with a really dark skin tone, if there would be a subtle difference. I haven't got anyone handy at the moment to test that theory so I just thought I'd put it out there for others to mull it over. I also have skinny legs (calf is 15"" and above my knee is 17"") so they are not stretched much. But they are listed as stockings NOT tights, so I expected all this.
--I'm also 6 ft tall and 157 pounds and (with the aforementioned leg measurements) the stockings made it to 2 inches over my knees. They seemed to stay up for the test walk around the house...but the event I'm getting them for is not for a while so I can't say how long they'll stay up or if they stretch much.
So pretty much the only reason I took off one star was because they are hand wash. Not that that's going to stop me from putting them in a laundry bag on gentle cycle (I DON'T do hand wash!)  ;) Leg Avenue Women's Nylon B/W Striped Stockings, One Size",4.0

"Unfortunately, I'm big.  I have fat thighs and I know it.  But when something says ""one size fits most,"" I expect it not to cut off my circulation.  I understand, because of my size, that I would normally need garters for stockings, since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me.  However, I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they won't cut off my circulation.  I'm only a size 12, which is still in the ""average"" range, so why a ""one size fits most"" item won't fit an average-sized person is beyond me.  From now on, I'm buying stockings that have size categories that INCLUDE Queen sizes. Good as long as you don't wear double-digit size.",2.0

"If you have legs like in the image provided, you're good to go.  So, please disregard this message.  For you ladies with extra, beautiful, and luscious flesh, you have two choices.

"Arrived quickly and as pictured.  The material is thin but for the price is reasonable.  My legs are on the thin side and so these socks aren't tight but the elastic at the top keeps them from falling down since my thighs are normal sized.

The first pair that came had a hole in one of the socks but when I contacted the seller, they promptly responded and sent me a replacement pair.

"I've purchased these shoes before with good success, they lasted about a year before there was very visible wear and tear. However I purchased a recent pair back in Sept (2017), that December the fabric started to tear around the elastic on the left side of the right shoe.

I contacted the seller (Gbrandshop) about a warranty/refund but they sent me to Vans for that. Vans shut the case down outright, stating they only warranty shoes bought through their authorized resellers, I was asked to handle it through the Amazon shop. Back to Gbrandshop, they never responded to another email after the initial finger point.

I contacted Amazon and got the refund handled through their A-Z policy, Amazon is the clear winner in customer service here. Disappointed with Vans' customer service on this, the quality of their shoes (hopefully it was just a bad run), and especially the customer service of Gbrandshop Comfortable slip on, major quality issues",2.0

"Super comfortable and very stylish. It's been a long time since I bought a pair of VANS and I've been eyeballing the black/charcoal checkered slip-ons for a while... wish I hadn't waited so long. My absolute favorite pair of shoes! A little stiff at first, which is normal for canvas, but broke in very quickly. My feet are wide at the front and narrow at the heel so I have trouble finding shoes that don't either squish my toes (potentially causing permanent nerve damage) or slide off my heels causing blisters and abrasions. The toe box of these shoes is wide enough to accomodate my wider front. They also have a padded heel which has molded to fit me perfectly: no more sliding off ---> no more blisters/abrasions = happy feet! I am extremely satisfied and happy with this purchase.

These Vans slay me; the checkerboard style reminds me of high school, 5,000 years ago, and dancing with the Italian Formula One team in Long Beach 4,000 years ago.  That's right, I'm having a mid-life crisis and Vans helps assuage my desires. Vans Checkerboard Slip-Ons",5.0

"I must say, I love Vans slip-ons for what they are, usually.

The first issue, I ordered these in men's 11, I  am a 10.5, and surprisingly they were small. Not bad, I'll break them in, whatever.

The second issue, from day one they leak through the soles. The bottom up, soaked feet. Constantly. Of course it rained the first day I wore them out.

But I love these shoes, they are too small and they leak. No big deal until I'm at the game and I use the restroom and step in piss.

Style wise, these are simply great shoes. Function wise, these shoes (the ones I received from my Amazon order) were and are a failure.

"This is THE solution for shoes appropriate to physical therapy after hip replacement surgery. They are just snug enough. To be fair, I wear my shoes loosely as a rule, so your mileage may vary. Still, considering the limitations one must observe for the first few weeks of recovery, these things shouldn't need to be too tight. After all of the other expense (even with pretty decent insurance) of the procedure, popping fifty bucks for these things seemed pretty reasonable.

Hell, i might even wear them after i recover.... hip replacement shoes!",5.0

Been wearing them for 32 years. from the beaches of California to the streets of D.C. even the canyons of Zion, Red Rock and North Rim.

Great for Hacky Sack, summer days at the beach... and for causing new and interesting aromas when worn without socks, heheheh.
I wear 10.5 US Mens... these fit as expected. Always they start a bit snug. I wear them a few hours at a time until they stretch and get a little torn here and there.
Funny thing is, there is no real arch support in these things - and they only come in one width that I know of - and of course, I wear at least an E width in boots - and I have arches that rival any bridge... but they never make my feet hurt...?

"The first problem is the sizing of these shoes. I wear a mens size 9.5 M, I ordered a mens 10 M expecting to get a little extra room. What I got instead was a shoe that was more in line with a size 7 narrow. I could not even fit my toes in the opening. The shoe is clearly stamped 10M, definitely a mis-sizing. The other problem had to do with the quality of the shoe's upper part. The canvas used is very thin and flimsy feeling. Also the seams were all ragged and unfinished on the inside.

"They are your standard Vans Slip on shoes. They run in the same sizes as my Converse, so they fit well. I tried a pair on in the stores thinking I would wear a 7.5 as that is what I would wear in my tennis shoes, but that was a bit too big and a 6.5 was just too small. The 7 that I got fit perfectly.

My left shoe has something like a flaw where the ball of my foot touches when I step down. It's not like that in the right, so I am assuming it's just a small flaw, but it's not a big deal. I am sure over time I won't eel this anymore.

Like Converse, I cannot wear shoes like this for too long. If I were going to walk for a long time I would not wear these shoes, but I have trouble wearing shoes with little support.

Upon slipping on these slippery delights not only did my sweet little toesie woesies slip away to a wonderland of comfort and bliss but my knee was almost intaniously better. I am now not only able to run, jump, and fly higher than I could ever before but I am also able to speak with animals and drink scolding hot beverages without the slightest burn to my mouth.

My son absolutely loves the Vans that I bought him for his birthday. The white canvas is extremely stylish and cleans relatively easily. There have been no complaints of discomfort when wearing the shoes and the slip on design is very well made. The only reason I have given this a 4 star ration is due to the sole of the right shoe tearing after 4 months of wear. This should be expected when you wear a pair of shoes everyday though. Overall the shoes hold up very well and compliment any outfit. Very stylish and comfortable,4.0

"My wife asked for these shoes for her birthday... and being an obedient husband, I immediately bought them and put them away for her until her birthday arrived.  She was delighted that I got her just what she wanted, but the women's size 6.5 that she normally wears is a bit tight and she asked if I could exchange them for a size 7.  Unfortunately, it was just past the 30 days return policy.  Now she has a pair of shoes too small for her and it seems like there is nothing that I can do.  The shoes are unworn (other than just trying them on for size) and in the original packaging... I'm wondering if Amazon would be willing to make an exchange for the women's size 7 red checkerboard Vans Unisex Slip On Skate Shoes.

"I am a big big fan of the Vans classic slip-on checkerboard shoe.  This is my fourth pair in my life.  I have had an olive green and black checkerboard pair, a turquoise/sky blue and black checkerboard pair and a black and white checkerboard pair when I about 12 years old.  I wish they would keep making the classic colors and stop phasing them out.  I especially like the styling of the black webbing between the tongue and the sidewalls.  This is my first all black pair and I'm really liking them.  The first pair of shoes I've ever had that I actually want to stay clean and looking brand new.  I really hope that Vans keep these classics in production forever!  I've become so addicted to the ease of the slip-on shoe.
The only down side might be that they are a bit tight on my toes and a tad uncomfortable and stiff at the beginning.  I know from past experience though, that they break in very quickly then they feel very comfortable.  Just be warned, if you wear them everyday, especially skateboarding, they will wear out quickly and eventually will wear holes in the soles I really hope that Vans keep these classics in production forever!",5.0

"These Navy Vans slip on's are my favorite shoes. I am on my 3rd pair and each pair lasts me about a year. And I wear them every day. By the end of the year, the dark navy color has faded to a light blue/gray color, and there are some small wear holes on the sides of the canvas, however I would argue they look even better at the end of the year than when I first buy them! It takes a couple months of constant use to get that nice faded look. Also, I traveled through South America and Asia for 6 months last year, and these shoes I wore almost every day while traveling, hiking, with socks, without socks, with shorts, and pants, and they look good and feel good every time. I'm 18 and these are the perfect style. Great Buy and I can't recommend these enough! (I would add a picture of my two worn pairs, but alas I'm away from home at the moment..)

"I have no idea what people see in these shoes. They seem alright at first, but they're basically just covered flip-flops, and you can walk about as far in them, which is to say barely at all. But at least flip-flops are good for the beach; these are just a flimsy and uncomfortable pair of shoes. Don't do it. Don't make your feet uncomfortable and give yourself blisters just because they look good. Get a real pair of sneakers that you can wear and do whatever you want in without ever having to worry about your feet. I regret this purchase and regret that in order to come to this conclusion I've already worn them outside too much to return them. I can't even decide whether I should put these in a donation bin or just throw them out, since I'm not sure that I want to inflict them on a needy person. 0 stars. Don't do it",1.0

"The color was not as expected and it seems like Vans changed their product because I've been wearing this model for some years now, bought a few pairs of it throughout the years always the same size, and now the shoe is much harder to put on so it feels smaller, but then after it's on, the foot moves around in the shoe. A smaller size just won't go on because the opening is too narrow.
Returned the shoe and went to the store to try on a few more pairs and had the same problem. The salesperson said they're getting a lot of similar complaints lately.

"I have had many pairs of Vans slip on shoes.  It usually takes at least a couple months to get them completely broken in, but once they are they are always my favorite leisure shoe.

"My daughter and husband both love these shoes, so I usually end up buying several pairs throughout the year. If these get used on an infrequent (once or twice a week) basis, they stay looking pretty decent and last long enough. If you're the type that wants to wear these all the time, don't expect them to last more than a couple of months: by that time, the rubber soles will start to pull away and the shoes will look sloppy.

NOTE: I've started only buying these shoes when they are ""sold by Amazon,"" some of the ones from marketplace sellers seemed to be sized differently. Otherwise off to Zappos I go (also owned by Amazon). Great look but they don't last as an everyday shoe",4.0

"My only complaint about these shoes is that the left shoe is slightly more difficult to put on. The heel cup seems to be tighter or cut slightly differently. Once one, the shoe feels the same as the right, and there is no excessive rubbing or tightness around the heel. The left was a struggle to get on for a week or so, but it's getting easier. I have had several pair of the Vans classic slip-on, and I have never had this problem before. Oh, and the label tag at the back of the right show wasn't completely glued on because of the seam where the white band of the sole overlapped in the back. Not a major issue. I just put some super glue back there before I wore them around and it's been fine since. Maybe these were factory ""B' grade shoes, I dunno. Still, they fit well, I can wear them around without any problems, and they look good.

***They ask if these shoes provide good arch support. I said ""No"", because they aren't really built for that, probably due to the 'classic' design. I've had several pairs of this style shoe from Vans over the years and I don't expect them to provide the arch support of a sportier sneaker. That being said, they do provide more arch support than a pair of Chucks. Classics as expected, but with a quirk or two",4.0

"I love the shoes! I was replacing another pair of slip ons that I wore off and on for 3 years. I finally wore a hole at the big toe spot so... I went for the men's 4.5 which equals women's 6. I want to give them 4 1/2 stars because the right shoe is ever so slightly tighter than the left,not the size but the top canvas. I will just wear it around the house to stretch it and that will be that. It certainly isn't something I'd return them over. Also I was thinking the posts that say to go up a half size, maybe they aren't used to the way slip on vans fit. They are not high on the top of your foot, that's why even no show.socks can be seen you need something in the shape of a ped.
Bottom line, my last pair lasted 3 years,you need to read what size you picked and they require a really really low sock or none at all and if you like the thicker socks, by all means go up a 1/2 size if you can. 4 1/2 almost a 5",4.0

"These are the best shoes ever, which is why they've been around forever.

I'm so lazy and my gut is getting big, so bending over to tie shoes and all that other shoe business is not the best part of my morning. My shower is for sure.

They're lightweight, relatively compact, crush/washable... great for frequent travel and being lazy, but ironically, not all that great for walking. They're comfortable yes, but supportive and tight fitting they are not.
Great for simply dicking around in, but don't go hiking or jogging in these. (I say that as if no one knew)

"My husband doesn't like to tie shoes and would rather wear his slippah everywhere. Hey, he's from Hawaii. He hates wearing shoes and he hates shopping. If he isn't wearing his black thick flip flops, he's wearing runners and he rarely runs.

He's held on to the his last dress up shoes, but even shoe polish won't hide all the cracks.

So I got him these. They are comfortable. They don't look to preppy (why we avoided loafers). They go easily from dressy casual in SoCal or Hawaii, to dressy mingling with Oscar-nominated actors/directors. The shoes have a good grip for slippery surfaces (their only drawback being they won't make good dance shoes for East Coast Swing or Tango).

These shoes convinced us to become fans of Vans. I now have Vans in my closet as well. My husband is pleased with this black on black classic",4.0

"I wore Vans regularly from about age 12 through college, then lost track of them after moving to the East Coast.  I always found Off The Walls very comfortable and relatively long lasting for canvas shoes.  Since I'm more of a geezer these days I opted for basic black instead of my old Jeff Spicoli checks.

These fit a little small from what I remember, and the construction feels different from Vans two decades ago.  It's to be expected.  I've been wearing these for a couple weeks and so far they wear fine.  I hope they last a long time, but after all they really are canvas boat shoes and the uppers won't last as long as leather.

If you buy these, get them a size bigger. Huge disappointment. The material seemed cheaper for some reason too. I bought a new pair at a real vans store and a size 7 fit perfectly and was quality material. I suggest going to a real vans store to buy these. Way too small, cheap",2.0
"The Vans classic slip on shoes are designed for long, low arch narrow feet.  If you have a high arch or sometimes order up a half size for width, steer clear of these shoes.  I wore them for a couple hours hoping they might stretch out a bit, but ultimately, they did not, and they were both tight and uncomfortable because what minimal arch support existed was in the wrong place.

If you have long, narrow feet, give them a try - they probably fit to size.  Otherwise, don't bother. Too narrow, too low for non-traditional size feet",2.0

I love these vans - they are comfortable and they look very sharp. Sizing was correct and I am pleased with the results. The shipping was handled well.

The consensus seemed to be that Vans are usually right where they should be on the size scale, but mine most certainly were not. And not even ""slightly small"" so I could get by wearing them, maybe stretch them out a bit over time. These mash my toes. I'm not even sure a half-size up would fit either.

"Van's was my first job when I was in high school, and slip on skate shoes were pretty much what I wore every day. These fit pretty much true to size, so if you wear a 9, get a 9. These shoes are SKATE shoes, so they are designed for ""feel"" of what's happening under your feet....important for a skater. If you are planning to walk long distances in these shoes, like ten miles, you might want to consider something else because these shoes don't have lots of cushioning, as they are designed. I don't get people who buy skate shoes then complain about this. Duh. These shoes look great with shorts or jeans, and since I'm too old to ride a skateboard anymore, I bought them primarily to make plane travel easier.

"I have been wearing the same type of sneakers for the past six years (3 different pairs, as I only where them to the pool on Saturdays/Sundays).  I always ordered them directly from Vans, although my son (who is an avid fan of Amazon; Scotsil@gmail.com, one of your most loyal and best customers, as he is a shopaholic) told me to order the sneakers from your site and, in fact, they were approximately $10 less expensive.  As soon as I got them, I checked the size (which was the same as I had ordered for my last three pairs) and then threw out the box, assuming (unfortunately) that they would fit.  After wearing them a number of times, I knew that they were way too big and were causing me back pain.  I therefore went to a local shoe repair shop and purchased pads (two per shoe, as the gap was so wide) to go on the back interior.  However, they are not working, although I do not believe they are a knockoff/imitation of a true Van's sneaker.  Please note that I rarely complain about these issues, especially when the amount in controvery is only $35.  However, it is extremely annoying as I threw out my old vans and now cannot wear the new ones which will require me to go to the store in the mall during this very busy Holiday Season.  I understand if there is nothing you can do to accomodate me but, if there is, it will transform me into the same customer my son is.  Thank you for your consideration.  Joseph Silver.

I recommend that people follow the size guide if they're women wanting to get it in a men's size. For example I wear an 8 in women shoes, but I wanted to get a men's size so I got a 6.5, Vans classic slip-on skate shoes",4.0
"Vans are great shoes - we buy them a lot for my autistic son since he can't do ties, and velcro is hard to find in adult mens shoes (big foot kid!) - so slip on vans it is!
We typically buy blue (the only color he'll wear) - but couldn't find blue in the right size so I got the white (it's cream colored actually) to dye blue. These shoes don't hold dye very well - so if you want an off white - or cream slip on sneaker - then this is perfect. If you are looking to dye it, or need white - think again. cream just like the pic - not white like the title",4.0

"I typically wear a size 8-9 (W) depending on the style/brand. I have several pairs of Converse (low-tops) and I get a size 7.5 (M) that fit perfectly. I figured that these would be relatively similar because they are kind of the same style - I was actually worried that they might be a little snug. Boy was I wrong, THESE ARE HUGE.

I wish I could wear them, but my feet just slide around inside. I can't return them because I don't live in the US and paying to return would cost an insane amount. I will probably give them to my brother. Huge..",2.0

"I love these shoes.  The size fit just as expected and I wear these into the ground until I purchase the next pair.  The black color even lets me get away with comfortable (casual) office attire and even goes well enough with some of my (dressier) pants.  The one problem I seem to keep having is holes in the sole, near the ball of my foot.  This isn't pleasant even when it's just a tad wet outside.  I will keep buying these as long as they keep making them. Classic!",4.0
Make sure you get a size bigger cuz these shoes are super tight on wide feet and impossible to stretch OK,3.0
"With most canvas shoes I find the sole starts to tear away from the canvas, near the ball of the foot especially. While this did happen with these shoes, over time, I find they did last considerably longer than the others I have purchased. All in all a very comfortable shoe. These were my 'best-man' shoes for my buddy's wedding. Sole'd out",4.0

"Best ""anything"" shoes. Wear them everyday, they've gone through any climate condition, dust, water, snow, and sand. I love them. Awesomeness",5.0
"I ordered these in men's 6.5/women's 8, which is my true size.  It was a struggle to get my feet all the way into the shoes because the upper is so tight.  If I order a half size up though, my heels will slip out of the back.  So, while the length of the shoe is true, the space between the insole and upper only allows for a pancake thin foot!  If these are the only shoes someone wears, it's probably because their grossly misshapen feet won't fit into normal shoes!

That being said, I did receive my shipment quickly.  The sizing on this page was very misleading, but I looked at shoezoo's website to make sure the size I ordered would be the size I received (they were the vendor that came up when I chose my size from the drop down).  I only wish they offered free returns. Strange fit",2.0

"Although these shoes are comfortable and easy to put on and take off, they destroy the integrity of almost any outfit I put on.  Anyone with fashion sense will advise against wearing these out.  They are more like house slippers.  You're more likely to get laid wearing Crocs. Comfortable but Frumpy",2.0
"I loved these as a kid and decided to give them a shot as an adult and they are just as cool as when I was a kid. Great fit to. We will see if the build quality holds up like they did when I was a kid. My guess is no, but we will see. Just like the 80's again!!!",5.0
